    <h1>The ldapcompare Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Perform compare operations in an LDAP directory server.  Compare operations may be used to efficiently determine whether a specified entry has a given value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exit code for this tool will indicate whether processing was successful or unsuccessful, and to provide a basic indication of the reason for unsuccessful attempts.  By default, it will use an exit code of zero (which corresponds to the LDAP 'success' result) if all compare operations completed with a result code of either 'compare false' or 'compare true' (integer values 5 and 6, respectively), but if the --useCompareResultCodeAsExitCode argument is provided, only one compare assertion is performed, and it yields an exit code of 'compare false' or 'compare true', then the numeric value for that result code will be used as the exit code.  If any error occurs during processing, then the exit code will be a nonzero value that reflects the first error result that was encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attribute type and assertion value to use for the compare operations will typically be provided as the first unnamed trailing argument provided on the command line.  It should be formatted with the name or OID of the target attribute type followed by a single colon and the string representation of the assertion value.  Alternatively, the attribute name or OID may be followed by two colons and the base64-encoded representation of the assertion value, or it may be followed by a colon and a less-than symbol to indicate that the assertion value should be read from a file (in which case the exact bytes of the file, including line breaks, will be used as the assertion value).
    </p>
    <p>
      The DNs of the entries to compare may either be provided on the command line as additional unnamed trailing arguments after the provided attribute-value assertion, or they may be read from a file whose path is provided using the --dnFile argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the attribute-value assertion is provided on the command line as an unnamed trailing argument, then the same assertion will be performed for all operations.  If multiple types of assertions should be performed, then you may use the --assertionFile argument to specify the path to a file containing both attribute-value assertions and entry DNs.
    </p>

The JSON format may also include additional fields.
        <br>

        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--scriptFriendly</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the output should be generated in a script-friendly format.  This argument is not used, as the output will always be in a script-friendly format, and the --outputFormat argument may be used to customize the format in which the output is written.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-v</tt> / <tt>--verbose</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should generate verbose output.  If this is provided, then complete details about the result of each compare operation will be written to standard error.  If this is not provided, then that detail will only be written for operations that include an error result or that include one or more response controls.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--useCompareResultCodeAsExitCode</tt> &mdash; Use the integer value of the compare operation result code as the tool exit code.  This primarily applies to cases in which only a single compare assertion is processed and the response to that compare operation has a result code of either 'compare false' (integer value 5) or 'compare true' (integer value 6).  By default, the tool will use an exit code of zero in such cases to indicate that processing completed successfully, but the exit code may be useful in scripts to more easily obtain the result of the compare operation.  Note that if multiple compare operations are all processed successfully, then the tool will always return an exit code of zero, and if an error is encountered during processing, then the exit code will reflect the LDAP result code for that associated error.  This option only affects the tool exit code and does not alter the visible output in any way.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use an LDAP compare operation to determine whether entry 'uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' has a value of 'Austin' for the 'l' attribute.  The result of the compare operation will be displayed in the default tab-delimited text format.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    ldapcompare --hostname ds.example.com --port 636 --useSSL \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com l:Austin \
         uid=jdoe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</pre></blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a series of LDAP compare operations to determine which of the entries with DNs are read from the file 'entry-dns.txt' have a 'title' value of 'manager'.  The result of each compare operation will be displayed in the comma-separated values (CSV) format, with all unnecessary output suppressed.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    ldapcompare --hostname ds.example.com --port 636 --useSSL \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com --dnFile entry-dns.txt \
         --outputFormat csv --terse title:manager</pre></blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a series of LDAP compare operations using both entry DNs and attribute-value assertions read from the file 'compare-assertions.txt'.  The results of the compare operations will be written in JSON format to the file 'compare-assertion-results.json', and verbose output about the processing will be written to standard error.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    ldapcompare --hostname ds.example.com --port 636 --useSSL \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com \
         --assertionFile compare-assertions.txt --outputFormat json \
         --outputFile compare-assertion-results.json --verbose</pre></blockquote>
