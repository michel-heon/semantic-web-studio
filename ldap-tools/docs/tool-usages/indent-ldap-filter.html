    <h1>The indent-ldap-filter Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Parses a provided LDAP filter string and displays it a multi-line form that makes it easier to understand its hierarchy and embedded components.  If possible, it may also be able to simplify the provided filter in certain ways (for example, by removing unnecessary levels of hierarchy, like an AND embedded in an AND).
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>indent-ldap-filter <i>{arguments}</i> <i>{filter}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--indent-spaces <i>{numSpaces}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the number of spaces that should be used to indent each additional level of filter hierarchy.  A value of zero indicates that the hierarchy should be displayed without any additional indenting.  If this argument is not provided, a default indent of two spaces will be used.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than 0 or greater than 2 147 483 647.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--do-not-simplify</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should not make any attempt to simplify the provided filter.  If this argument is not provided, then the tool will try to simplify the provided filter (for example, by removing unnecessary levels of hierarchy, like an AND embedded in an AND).
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--interactive</tt> &mdash; Launch the tool in interactive mode.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--outputFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified file instead of to the console.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--appendToOutputFile</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--teeOutput</tt> &mdash; Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must also be provided.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-H</tt> / <tt>--help</tt> &mdash; Display usage information for this program.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-V</tt> / <tt>--version</tt> &mdash; Display version information for this program.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--propertiesFilePath <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a properties file used to specify default values for arguments not supplied on the command line.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--generatePropertiesFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default values for arguments.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--noPropertiesFile</tt> &mdash; Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--suppressPropertiesFileComment</tt> &mdash; Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
