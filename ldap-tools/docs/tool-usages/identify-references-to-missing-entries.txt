Usage for identify-references-to-missing-entries:

This tool may be used to identify entries containing one or more attributes
which reference entries that do not exist.  This may require the ability to
perform unindexed searches and/or the ability to use the simple paged results
control.

Usage:  identify-references-to-missing-entries {options}

Available options include:

  LDAP Connection and Authentication Arguments

    -h, --hostname {host}
        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        bind password.
    -Z, --useSSL
        Use SSL when communicating with the directory server.
    -q, --useStartTLS
        Use StartTLS when communicating with the directory server.
    --defaultTrust
        Use the JVM's default trust store, and optionally an additional trust
        store specified using the --trustStorePath argument, to
        non-interactively determine whether to trust any certificate chain
        presented during TLS negotiation.  If the chain cannot be trusted based
        on any of those sources, then negotiation will fail without prompting
        about whether to trust it.
    -X, --trustAll
        Trust any certificate presented by the directory server.
    -K, --keyStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as the key store for obtaining client
        certificates when communicating securely with the directory server.
    -W, --keyStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the key store contents.
    -u, --keyStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the key
        store contents.
    --promptForKeyStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the key store contents.
    --keyStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the key store
        file.
    -P, --trustStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as trust store when determining whether to
        trust a certificate presented by the directory server.
    -T, --trustStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the trust store contents.
    -U, --trustStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the trust
        store contents.
    --promptForTrustStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the trust store contents.
    --trustStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the trust store
        file.
    -N, --certNickname {nickname}
        The nickname (alias) of the client certificate in the key store to
        present to the directory server for SSL client authentication.
    --enableSSLDebugging
        Enable Java's low-level support for debugging SSL/TLS communication.
        This is equivalent to setting the 'javax.net.debug' property to 'all'.
    -o, --saslOption {name=value}
        A name-value pair providing information to use when performing SASL
        authentication.
    --useSASLExternal
        Use the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism to authenticate.
    --helpSASL
        Provide information about the supported SASL mechanisms, including the
        properties available for use with each.

  Other Arguments

  * -b, --baseDN {dn}
        The search base DN(s) to use to find entries with references to other
        entries.  At least one base DN must be specified.
  * -A, --attribute {attr}
        The attribute(s) for which to find missing references.  At least one
        attribute must be specified, and each attribute must be indexed for
        equality searches and have values which are DNs.
    -z, --simplePageSize {num}
        The maximum number of entries to retrieve at a time when attempting to
        find entries with references to other entries.  This requires that the
        authenticated user have permission to use the simple paged results
        control, but it can avoid problems with the server sending entries too
        quickly for the client to handle.  By default, the simple paged results
        control will not be used.

  Usage Arguments

    --interactive
        Launch the tool in interactive mode.
    --outputFile {path}
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified
        file instead of to the console.
    --appendToOutputFile
        Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the
        --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
        provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
    --teeOutput
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as
        well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must
        also be provided.
    -H, --help
        Display usage information for this program.
    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.
    --propertiesFilePath {path}
        The path to a properties file used to specify default values for
        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

  * Indicates the argument is required

Examples

  Identify all entries below dc=example,dc=com in which either the member or
  uniqueMember attribute references an entry that does not exist.

    identify-references-to-missing-entries --hostname server.example.com \
         --port 389 --bindDN uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com \
         --bindPassword password --baseDN dc=example,dc=com \
         --attribute member --attribute uniqueMember --simplePageSize 100
