    <h1>The ldapmodify Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Apply a set of add, delete, modify, and/or modify DN operations to a directory server.  Supply the changes to apply in LDIF format, either from standard input or from a file specified with the 'ldifFile' argument.  Change records must be separated by at least one blank line.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Read the changes to apply from standard input and send them to the target directory server over an unencrypted LDAP connection.  Any change records that don't include a changetype will be treated as entries to be added.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    ldapmodify --hostname ldap.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com --bindPassword password \
         --defaultAdd</pre></blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Read the changes to apply from the specified LDIF and apply them to all entries matching filter '(objectClass=person)' using the simple paged results control to retrieve no more than 100 entries at a time.  The communication will be encrypted with SSL, and if the first server is unavailable, the second server will be tried.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    ldapmodify --hostname ds1.example.com --port 636 \
         --hostname ds2.example.com --port 636 --useSSL \
