    <h1>The collect-support-data Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Collect and package system information useful in troubleshooting problems.  The information is packaged as a zip archive that can be sent to a technical support representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information collected may include configuration files, server monitor entries, portions of log files, JVM thread stack dumps, system metrics, and other data that may be helpful in diagnosing problems, understanding server performance, or otherwise assisting with support requests.  Although the tool will do its best to obscure or omit sensitive data, and the entire archive may be encrypted if you desire, you may wish to review the resulting support data archive to ensure verify its contents.  Further, the archive will include a summary of any potential problems or concerns that are identified in the course of collecting the support data.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--outputPath <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the path to which the support data archive should be written.  If this path references a file that already exists, then that file will be overwritten with the new support data archive.  If it references a directory that already exists, then a new support data archive will be created in that directory with a name that is dynamically generated.  If it references a file that does not exist, then the parent directory must exist, and a new support data archive file will be created with that path and name.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--encrypt</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the resulting support data archive should be encrypted.  If the --passphraseFile argument is provided in conjunction with the --generatePassphrase argument, then a passphrase will dynamically generated and written to the specified file.  If the --passphraseFile argument is provided without the --generatePassphrase argument, then that file must exist and it will be read to obtain the passphrase used to generate the encryption key.  If the --passphraseFile argument is not provided, then the encryption passphrase will be interactively requested.  Note that when providing an encrypted collect-support-data archive to support personnel, it is strongly recommended that the passphrase be provided over a separate channel than the encrypted archive itself to help prevent unauthorized third-party access.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--passphraseFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a file containing the passphrase used to encrypt or decrypt the support data archive.  If this file exists, then it must contain exactly one line that consists entirely of the encryption passphrase.  If this file does not exist, then the --generatePassphrase argument must have also been provided, and the generated passphrase will be written into the specified file.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--generatePassphrase</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should automatically generate the passphrase used to generate the encryption key and write it to the file specified by the --passphraseFile argument.  This argument may only be used if both the --encrypt and --passphraseFile arguments are also provided.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--decrypt <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; Decrypts the encrypted support data archive contained in the specified file.  If the --passphraseFile argument is provided, then it will be used to obtain the passphrase to use to generate the encryption key.  Otherwise, the passphrase will be interactively requested.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>

        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--collectReplicationStateDump</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the support data archive should include a replication state dump, which may be several megabytes in size.  This argument cannot be used in conjunction with the --noLDAP argument.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--includeBinaryFiles</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the support data archive should include any binary files that would have otherwise been omitted, but that may contain information that could be helpful in investigating the underlying issue.  Note that sensitive information in these binary files may not be obscured or redacted in the same way that it would be in plain text files.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--sequential</tt> &mdash; Collect data sequentially rather than in parallel.  This has the effect of reducing the initial memory footprint of this tool, but at the expense of taking longer to complete.  Use this option if running without it results in out-of-memory errors.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--securityLevel <i>{none|obscure-secrets|maximum}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the degree to which the tool will attempt to obscure or omit potentially sensitive information.  A value of 'none' indicates that the tool will not attempt to obscure or redact any information.  A value of 'obscure-secrets' indicates that the tool will attempt to obscure secret information (like the values of sensitive configuration properties) and omit log files containing user data (like the data recovery log).  A value of 'maximum' indicates that the tool will take even more drastic measures, like omitting access log files and obscuring attribute values in entry DNs and search filters, but at the risk of omitting information that could be useful in investigating the associated issue.  If this is not provided, a value of 'obscure-secrets' will be used by default.
        <br>
        A provided value should be one of the following:  'maximum', 'none', 'obscure-secrets'.

    <h3>Communication Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--useRemoteServer</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the collect-support-data request should be sent to a server over LDAP rather than operating against the local instance.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--useAdministrativeSession</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should attempt to use an administrative session to process all operations using a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying to diagnose problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal worker threads are busy processing other requests.  This argument may only be used in conjunction with the --useRemoteServer argument.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
