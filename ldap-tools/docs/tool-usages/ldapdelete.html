    <h1>The ldapdelete Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Delete one or more entries from an LDAP directory server.  You can provide the DNs of the entries to delete using named arguments, as trailing arguments, from a file, or from standard input.  Alternatively, you can identify entries to delete using a search base DN and filter.
    </p>
