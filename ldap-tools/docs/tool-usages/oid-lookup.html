    <h1>The oid-lookup Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Search the OID registry to retrieve information about items that match a given OID or name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The string to use to search the OID registry should be provided as an unnamed trailing argument.  All items in the OID registry will be examined, and any items that contain the provided string in its OID, name, type, origin, or URL will be matched.  If no search string is provided, the entire OID registry will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>oid-lookup <i>{arguments}</i> <i>[{lookup-string}]</i></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--schema-path <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a file or directory containing schema definitions to use to augment the default OID registry.  If provided, the value may be the path to an LDIF file containing a subschema subentry, or it may be the path to a directory containing one or more schema files (in which case the files will be processed in lexicographic order by file name).  This argument may be provided multiple times to provide multiple schema paths.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--output-format <i>{csv|json|multi-line|tab-delimited}</i></tt> &mdash; The format to use for the output.  The value may be one of 'csv', 'json', 'multi-line', or 'tab-delimited'.  If the output format is not specified, then the 'multi-line' format will be used by default.
        <br>
        A provided value should be one of the following:  'json', 'tab-delimited', 'csv', 'multi-line'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--exact-match</tt> &mdash; Only return OID registry items that contain a string (the OID, name, type, origin, or URL) that exactly matches the provided search string (ignoring differences in capitalization).  By default, the tool will use substring matching rather than exact matching.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--terse</tt> &mdash; Generate only the minimal amount of output with no additional comments.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--outputFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified file instead of to the console.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--appendToOutputFile</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
