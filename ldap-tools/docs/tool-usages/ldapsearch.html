    <h1>The ldapsearch Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Process one or more searches in an LDAP directory server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The criteria for the search request can be specified in a number of different ways, including providing all of the details directly via command-line arguments, providing all of the arguments except the filter via command-line arguments and specifying a file that holds the filters to use, or specifying a file that includes a set of LDAP URLs with the base DN, scope, filter, and attributes to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the examples below for a number of sample command lines for this tool.
    </p>

        <tt>--retryFailedOperations</tt> &mdash; Indicates that, if a search fails in a way that indicates the connection to the server may no longer be valid, the tool should automatically create a new connection and re-try the search before reporting it as a failure.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-r <i>{num}</i></tt> / <tt>--ratePerSecond <i>{num}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies a maximum search rate that the tool should be permitted to achieve.  Note that this limit applies only to the rate at which the client issues search requests and not to the rate at which the server may send matching entries.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than 1 or greater than 2Â 147Â 483Â 647.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--useAdministrativeSession</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should attempt to use an administrative session to process all operations using a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful when trying to diagnose problems in a server that is unresponsive because all normal worker threads are busy processing other requests.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

If this is not provided, or if an error is encountered while processing the search, then the tool exit code will reflect the LDAP result code received during search processing (or an appropriate client-side result code if a problem was encountered before sending any searches).  Note that because some operating systems do not allow exit code values greater than 255, that will be the maximum exit value for this tool even if more than 255 entries are returned.  Also note that this argument can only be used when processing a single search.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-S <i>{value}</i></tt> / <tt>--sortOrder <i>{value}</i></tt> &mdash; Indicates that all search requests should include the server-side sort request control (as described in RFC 2891) to request that the server sort results before returning them to the client.  The sort order should be a comma-separated list of attribute names, each of which may be optionally prefixed by '+' (to indicate that sorting should be in ascending order for that attribute) or '-' (for descending order), and may be optionally followed by a colon and the name or OID for the ordering matching rule that should be used when sorting.  Ascending order will be used if neither '+' or '-' is specified, and if no matching rule ID is given then the attribute type's own ordering rule will be used.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--simplePageSize <i>{value}</i></tt> &mdash; Indicates that all search requests should include the simple paged results control (as described in RFC 2696) to indicate that the search should return entries in pages of no more than the specified size.  This can be useful for searches that must return a large number of entries but the server restricts the number of entries that may be returned for any search.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than 1 or greater than 2Â 147Â 483Â 647.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--virtualAttributesOnly</tt> &mdash; Indicates that all search requests should include the UnboundID-proprietary virtual attributes only request control to indicate that the server should only include virtual attributes in entries that are returned.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-G <i>{before:after:index:count | before:after:value}</i></tt> / <tt>--virtualListView <i>{before:after:index:count | before:after:value}</i></tt> &mdash; Indicates that all search requests should include the virtual list view (VLV) request control (as described in draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-vlv) to indicate that the server should return the specified subset of the sorted search results (and the 'sortOrder' argument must also be given to specify the sort order).  The value should be a colon-delimited list indicating which page of results to return, and it may take one of two forms.  In either case, the first element specifies the number of elements to return before the entry identified as the start of the results, and the second is the number of entries after the 'start' entry.  The third element identifies the start of the result set, and it may be either an integer offset (in which the first entry in the result set has an offset of one), or a string that provides a value for which the server should identify the first entry whose value for the primary sort attribute is greater than or equal to the given string.  In the event that an offset is provided, a fourth element must also be given to indicate the expected number of entries in the result set, or zero if that is not known.  For example, a value of '0:9:1:0' indicates that the server should return the first ten entries of the result set (starting at offset 1, which is the first entry, return the zero previous entries and the nine following entries, with no indication of how many entries match the search criteria).  Alternately, a value of '0:99:smith' indicates that the server should the first 100 entries in the result set for which the primary sort attribute has a value that is greater than or equal to 'smith'.

    <h3>Entry Transformation Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--excludeAttribute <i>{attr}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the name or OID of an attribute that should be excluded from search result entries.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to exclude.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--redactAttribute <i>{attr}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the name or OID of an attribute whose values should be redacted to indicate that the attribute is present in search result entries but to hide the actual values for that attribute.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple attributes to redact.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--hideRedactedValueCount</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the output should not reveal the number of values contained in redacted attributes.  If this argument is present, then a redacted attribute will only ever have a single value of '***REDACTED***'.  If this argument is not present, then a redacted attribute with multiple values will still have the same number of values that it originally had, but those values will be '***REDACTED1***', '***REDACTED2***', etc.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--scrambleJSONField <i>{fieldName}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the name of a JSON field whose values should be scrambled.  If the --scrambleAttribute argument is used to scramble any attributes whose values may be JSON objects, then all JSON field names will be preserved and only the values of the specified fields will be scrambled.  If this argument is given (and it may be provided multiple times to target multiple JSON fields), then only the specified fields will have their values scrambled.  If this argument is not provided, then any of the scramble attribute values that are JSON objects will have all values scrambled.  JSON field names will be treated in a case-insensitive manner.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--scrambleRandomSeed <i>{value}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the value that will be used to seed the random number generator used in the course of scrambling attribute values.  If a random seed is provided, then scrambling the same entry with the same seed should consistently yield the same scrambled representations.  If no random seed is specified, an appropriate value will be selected automatically.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than -2Â 147Â 483Â 648 or greater than 2Â 147Â 483Â 647.

This argument may be provided multiple times as long as the --renameAttributeTo argument is also provided the same number of times, and the order of --renameAttributeFrom values must correspond to the order of --renameAttributeTo values.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--renameAttributeTo <i>{attr}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the new name to use for an attribute to be renamed.  This argument must be provided the same number of times as the --renameAttributeFrom argument.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--moveSubtreeFrom <i>{attr}</i></tt> &mdash; Specifies the base DN for a subtree to be moved to another location in the DIT, with this source DN being replaced with the base DN specified using the --moveSubtreeTo argument.  This argument may be provided multiple times as long as the --moveSubtreeTo argument is also provided the same number of times, and the order of --moveSubtreeFrom values must correspond to the order of --moveSubtreeTo values.
        <br>
        A provided value must be able to be parsed as an LDAP distinguished name as described in RFC 4514.

      <li>Establishes an SSL-encrypted LDAP connection to directory.example.com:636, interactively prompting the user about whether to trust the certificate presented by the directory server.  The tool will then bind with the SASL PLAIN mechanism using an authentication ID of 'u:jdoe' and a password read from a file.  It will then issue a search request for each filter in a given file, writing the results for each search into a separate output file.</li>

      <li>Establishes an LDAP connection to directory.example.com:389 that is secured with the StartTLS extended operation, using the information in the provided trust store file to determine whether to trust the certificate presented by the directory server.

The output will be written to a specified output file as well as displayed on standard output.</li>
