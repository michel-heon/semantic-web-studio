    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate the contents of the 'data.ldif' file using the schema defined in the specified directory server using four concurrent threads.  All types of validation will be performed, and information about any errors will be written to the 'rejects.ldif' file.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    validate-ldif --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --ldifFile data.ldif --rejectFile rejects.ldif --numThreads 4</pre></blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Validate the contents of the 'data.ldif' file using the schema defined in LDIF files contained in the /ds/config/schema directory using a single thread.  Any errors resulting from entries that do not have exactly one structural object class or from values which violate the syntax for their associated attribute types will be ignored.  Information about any other failures will be written to the 'rejects.ldif' file.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><pre>    validate-ldif --schemaDirectory /ds/config/schema --ldifFile data.ldif \
         --rejectFile rejects.ldif --ignoreStructuralObjectClasses \
