Usage for collect-support-data:

Collect and package system information useful in troubleshooting problems.  The
information is packaged as a zip archive that can be sent to a technical
support representative.

Information collected may include configuration files, server monitor entries,
portions of log files, JVM thread stack dumps, system metrics, and other data
that may be helpful in diagnosing problems, understanding server performance,
or otherwise assisting with support requests.  Although the tool will do its
best to obscure or omit sensitive data, and the entire archive may be encrypted
if you desire, you may wish to review the resulting support data archive to
ensure verify its contents.  Further, the archive will include a summary of any
potential problems or concerns that are identified in the course of collecting
the support data.

Usage:  collect-support-data {options}

Available options include:

  LDAP Connection and Authentication Arguments

    -h, --hostname {host}
        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        bind password.
    -Z, --useSSL
        Use SSL when communicating with the directory server.
    -q, --useStartTLS
        Use StartTLS when communicating with the directory server.
    --defaultTrust
        Use the JVM's default trust store, and optionally an additional trust
        store specified using the --trustStorePath argument, to
        non-interactively determine whether to trust any certificate chain
        presented during TLS negotiation.  If the chain cannot be trusted based
        on any of those sources, then negotiation will fail without prompting
        about whether to trust it.
    -X, --trustAll
        Trust any certificate presented by the directory server.
    -K, --keyStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as the key store for obtaining client
        certificates when communicating securely with the directory server.
    -W, --keyStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the key store contents.
    -u, --keyStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the key
        store contents.

        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the key store contents.
    --keyStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the key store
        file.
    -P, --trustStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as trust store when determining whether to
        trust a certificate presented by the directory server.
    -T, --trustStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the trust store contents.
    -U, --trustStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the trust
        store contents.
    --promptForTrustStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the trust store contents.
    --trustStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the trust store
        file.

        Provide information about the supported SASL mechanisms, including the
        properties available for use with each.

  Output Arguments

    --outputPath {path}
        Specifies the path to which the support data archive should be written.
        If this path references a file that already exists, then that file will
        be overwritten with the new support data archive.  If it references a
        directory that already exists, then a new support data archive will be
        created in that directory with a name that is dynamically generated.
        If it references a file that does not exist, then the parent directory
        must exist, and a new support data archive file will be created with
        that path and name.
    --encrypt
        Indicates that the resulting support data archive should be encrypted.
        If the --passphraseFile argument is provided in conjunction with the
        --generatePassphrase argument, then a passphrase will dynamically
        generated and written to the specified file.  If the --passphraseFile
        argument is provided without the --generatePassphrase argument, then
        that file must exist and it will be read to obtain the passphrase used
        to generate the encryption key.  If the --passphraseFile argument is
        not provided, then the encryption passphrase will be interactively
        requested.  Note that when providing an encrypted collect-support-data
        archive to support personnel, it is strongly recommended that the
        passphrase be provided over a separate channel than the encrypted
        archive itself to help prevent unauthorized third-party access.
    --passphraseFile {path}
        The path to a file containing the passphrase used to encrypt or decrypt
        the support data archive.  If this file exists, then it must contain
        exactly one line that consists entirely of the encryption passphrase.
        If this file does not exist, then the --generatePassphrase argument
        must have also been provided, and the generated passphrase will be
        written into the specified file.
    --generatePassphrase
        Indicates that the tool should automatically generate the passphrase
        used to generate the encryption key and write it to the file specified
        by the --passphraseFile argument.  This argument may only be used if
        both the --encrypt and --passphraseFile arguments are also provided.
    --decrypt {path}
        Decrypts the encrypted support data archive contained in the specified
        file.  If the --passphraseFile argument is provided, then it will be
        used to obtain the passphrase to use to generate the encryption key.
        Otherwise, the passphrase will be interactively requested.

  Data Collection Arguments

    --collectExpensiveData
        Indicates that the tool should attempt to collect information that may
        be time-consuming or resource-intensive to obtain, or that may affect
        server performance or responsiveness.
    --collectReplicationStateDump
        Indicates that the support data archive should include a replication
        state dump, which may be several megabytes in size.  This argument
        cannot be used in conjunction with the --noLDAP argument.
    --includeBinaryFiles
        Indicates that the support data archive should include any binary files
        that would have otherwise been omitted, but that may contain
        information that could be helpful in investigating the underlying
        issue.  Note that sensitive information in these binary files may not
        be obscured or redacted in the same way that it would be in plain text
        files.
    --archiveExtensionSource
        Indicates that the resulting support data archive should include the
        source code (if available) for any third-party extensions installed in
        the server.
    --sequential
        Collect data sequentially rather than in parallel.  This has the effect
        of reducing the initial memory footprint of this tool, but at the
        expense of taking longer to complete.  Use this option if running
        without it results in out-of-memory errors.
    --securityLevel {none|obscure-secrets|maximum}
        Specifies the degree to which the tool will attempt to obscure or omit
        potentially sensitive information.  A value of 'none' indicates that
        the tool will not attempt to obscure or redact any information.  A
        value of 'obscure-secrets' indicates that the tool will attempt to
        obscure secret information (like the values of sensitive configuration
        properties) and omit log files containing user data (like the data
        recovery log).  A value of 'maximum' indicates that the tool will take
        even more drastic measures, like omitting access log files and
        obscuring attribute values in entry DNs and search filters, but at the
        risk of omitting information that could be useful in investigating the
        associated issue.  If this is not provided, a value of
        'obscure-secrets' will be used by default.
    --jstackCount {count}
        The number of times the jstack tool should be invoked to obtain stack
        traces of all threads running in the JVM.  A value of zero indicates
        that the jstack tool should not be invoked.  If this argument is not
        provided, the tool will be invoked ten times by default.
    --reportCount {count}
        The number of intervals of data to collect from tools that use
        interval-based sampling (e.g., vmstat, iostat, mpstat, etc.).  A value
        of zero indicates that no information should be collected from these
        tools.  If this argument is not provided, then data will be collected
        from ten intervals by default.
    --reportIntervalSeconds {seconds}
        The number of seconds that should elapse between intervals from tools
        that use interval-based sampling (e.g., vmstat, iostat, mpstat, etc.).
        If this argument is provided, the value must be greater than zero.  If
        it is not provided, an interval duration of one second will be used by
        default.
    --logTimeRange {startTime[,endTime]}
        Include log messages falling within the indicated time range.  The
        start and end time values should be formatted in the generalized time
        format (e.g., 'YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuuZ'), a format similar to the
        generalized time format but without the time zone indicator to indicate
        that the value should be in the local time zone (e.g.,
        'YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuu'), or the server's default log timestamp format
        (e.g., '[DD/MMM/YYYY:hh:mm:ss Z]' or '[DD/MMM/YYYY:hh:mm:ss.uuu Z]').
        If the end time is omitted, the current time will be used.
    --logDuration {duration}
        Include log messages within the specified duration before the current
        time.  If specified, the value must consist of an integer followed by a
        time unit, which may be one of millisecond, second, minute, hour, or
        day, or their plurals (e.g., '5 minutes' or '1 hour').
    --logFileHeadCollectionSizeKB {sizeKB}
        The amount of data in kilobytes that the tool should capture from the
        beginning of each log file.  If this is specified, then the value must
        be greater than or equal to zero.
    --logFileTailCollectionSizeKB {sizeKB}
        The amount of data in kilobytes that the tool should capture from the
        end of each log file.  If this is specified, then the value must be
        greater than or equal to zero.
    --pid {pid}
        Specifies the process ID of an additional process about which
        information should be collected.  This option may be useful for
        troubleshooting external server tools.  It may be provided multiple
        times to specify multiple process IDs.
    --comment {value}
        Provides a comment that will be included in a README file within the
        support data archive.  This comment may provide additional context
        about the issue being investigated.

  Communication Arguments

    --useRemoteServer
        Indicates that the collect-support-data request should be sent to a
        server over LDAP rather than operating against the local instance.
    --useAdministrativeSession
        Indicates that the tool should attempt to use an administrative session
        to process all operations using a dedicated pool of worker threads.
        This may be useful when trying to diagnose problems in a server that is
        unresponsive because all normal worker threads are busy processing
        other requests.  This argument may only be used in conjunction with the
        --useRemoteServer argument.
    --proxyToServerAddress {address}
        The address of a server to which the collect-support-data extended
        request should be forwarded.  This may be useful for retrieving support
        data information from a backend Directory Server instance that can only
        be accessed through a Directory Proxy Server.  The server to which the
        initial request will be sent (the one specified by the --hostname and
        --port arguments) must either be configured with an LDAP external
        server that has the specified proxy-to address and port values or there
        must be a server instance with that address and port in the topology
        registry.  This argument may only be provided if both the
        --useRemoteServer and --proxyToServerPort arguments are also given.
    --proxyToServerPort {port}
        The port of a server to which the collect-support-data extended request
        should be forwarded.  This argument may only be provided if both the
        --useRemoteServer and --proxyToServerAddress arguments are also given.
    --noLDAP
        Indicates that no attempt should be made to collect any information
        over LDAP.  This option should only be used as a last resort if the
        server is completely unresponsive or will not start, and it must not be
        used in conjunction with the --useRemoteServer argument.

  Other Arguments

    -n, --noPrompt
        Indicates that the tool should not interactively prompt for any
        information, but should fail if any required information is not
        provided.
    --dryRun
        Indicates that the tool should validate the set of arguments but should
        not actually generate the support data archive.  If the
        --useRemoteServer argument is provided, then the extended request will
        include the LDAP no-operation request control.

  Usage Arguments

    --interactive
        Launch the tool in interactive mode.
    -H, --help
        Display usage information for this program.
    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.
    --propertiesFilePath {path}
        The path to a properties file used to specify default values for
        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

Examples

  Collects information about the local server instance using the default
  settings

    collect-support-data --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com \
         --bindPasswordFile admin-pw.txt
