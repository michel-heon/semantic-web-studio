Usage for authrate:

Perform repeated authentications against an LDAP directory server, where each
authentication consists of a search to find a user followed by a bind to verify
the credentials for that user.

Usage:  authrate {options}

Available options include:

        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.

        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.

        initial search.  If this argument is provided, then the base DN pattern
        will be used to obtain the bind DNs.
    -a, --authType {authType}
        The type of authentication to perform.  Allowed values are:  SIMPLE,
        CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN.  If no value is provided, then SIMPLE

        control as described in draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-10.
    --searchControl {oid}[:{criticality}[:{stringValue}|::{base64Value}]]
        Indicates that search requests should include the specified request
        control.  This may be provided multiple times to include multiple
        search request controls.
    --bindControl {oid}[:{criticality}[:{stringValue}|::{base64Value}]]
        Indicates that bind requests should include the specified request
        control.  This may be provided multiple times to include multiple
        modify request controls.

  Rate Management Arguments

    -t, --numThreads {num}
        The number of threads to use to perform the authentication processing.
        If this is not provided, then a default of one thread will be used.
    -i, --intervalDuration {num}
        The length of time in seconds between output lines.  If this is not
        provided, then a default interval of five seconds will be used.
    -I, --numIntervals {num}
        The maximum number of intervals for which to run.  If this is not
        provided, then the tool will run until it is interrupted.
    -r, --ratePerSecond {auths-per-second}
        The target number of authorizations to perform per second.  It is still
        necessary to specify a sufficient number of threads for achieving this
        rate.  If neither this option nor --variableRateData is provided, then
        the tool will run at the maximum rate for the specified number of
        threads.
    --variableRateData {path}
        The path to a file containing information that can be used to cause the
        tool to vary the target rate over time.  Use the generateSampleRateFile
        argument to generate a sample rate definition file with comments that
        describe the required format for this file.
    --generateSampleRateFile {path}
        The path to a sample variable data rate file that should be generated.
        This file will contain comments that describe the expected format for
        the file to use with the variableRateData argument.
    --warmUpIntervals {num}
        The number of intervals to complete before beginning overall statistics
        collection.  Specifying a nonzero number of warm-up intervals gives the
        client and server a chance to warm up without skewing performance
        results.

  Other Arguments

    --timestampFormat {format}
        Indicates the format to use for timestamps included in the output.  A
        value of 'none' indicates that no timestamps should be included.  A
        value of 'with-date' indicates that both the date and the time should
        be included.  A value of 'without-date' indicates that only the time
        should be included.
    --suppressErrorResultCodes
        Indicates that information about the result codes for failed operations
        should not be displayed.
    -c, --csv
        Generate output in CSV format rather than a display-friendly format

Examples

  Test authentication performance by searching randomly across a set of one
  million users located below 'dc=example,dc=com' with ten concurrent threads
  and performing simple binds with a password of 'password'.  The searches will
  be performed anonymously.

    authrate --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com --bindPassword password \
         --baseDN dc=example,dc=com --scope sub \
         --filter "(uid=user.[1-1000000])" --credentials password \
         --numThreads 10

  Generate a sample variable rate definition file that may be used in
  conjunction with the --variableRateData argument.  The sample file will
  include comments that describe the format for data to be included in this
  file.

    authrate --generateSampleRateFile variable-rate-data.txt
