The certificate will be valid for 7300 days starting at midnight local time on January 1, 2017.  It will include a basic constraints extension that indicates the certificate can act as a certification authority, and a key usage extension that indicates that the key can be used for signing certificates and CRLs.  Also, display a command that can be used to obtain a similar result with the Java keytool utility.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Generates a certificate signing request intended to renew the existing certificate stored in alias 'server-cert' in the 'config/keystore' key store.  The request will use the same subject DN and set of extensions as the certificate currently stored in that alias, and it will be written to standard output in PEM format.</li>

         --use-existing-key-pair --inherit-extensions \
         --display-keytool-command</pre></blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses the 'ca-cert' certificate in key store 'config/keystore' to sign the certificate signing request (CSR) contained in file 'server-cert.csr' and writes the signed certificate to PEM-formatted output file 'server-cert.crt'.  The signed certificate will use the subject DN and set of extensions included in the request, and the resulting certificate will be valid for 730 days, starting immediately.

    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the key store file containing the certificates to list.  Either this argument or the --useJVMDefaultTrustStore argument must be provided, and if this argument is given, then the specified file must exist.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--use-jvm-default-trust-store</tt> &mdash; List certificates from the JVM-default trust store (/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/cacerts).
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-password <i>{password}</i></tt> &mdash; The password (also called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  A key store password is optional for some key store types, but may be required for others.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-password-file <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a file containing the password needed to access the contents of the key store.  A key store password is optional for some key store types, but may be required for others.  If a key store password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text key store password.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--prompt-for-keystore-password</tt> &mdash; Interactively prompt for the key store password.  A key store password is optional for some key store types, but may be required for others.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-type <i>{type}</i></tt> &mdash; The key store type for the key store.  This is usually not necessary when listing certificates, but it may be required in some cases (for example, when listing the certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS 140-2-compliant mode).  The value must be one of 'JKS' (for the Java Key Store format), 'PKCS12' (for the standard PKCS #12 format), 'PKCS11' (for PKCS #11 tokens), or 'BCFKS' (for the Bouncy Castle FIPS 140-2-compliant Key Store format).  If this is not provided, then an attempt will be made to automatically infer the correct key store type.
        <br>
        A provided value should be one of the following:  'pkcs#11', 'pkcs#12', 'jks', 'pkcs11', 'pkcs 11', 'pkcs12', 'pkcs 12', 'pkcs #12', 'bcfks', 'pkcs #11'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--alias <i>{alias}</i></tt> &mdash; The alias (also called a nickname) to use for the imported certificate.  If multiple certificates are to be imported, then the behavior depends on whether a private key will also be imported.  When importing a certificate chain along with a private key, then the alias must not already exist in the key store, and the private key and the entire certificate chain will be stored under this alias.  When importing a certificate for which the corresponding private key already exists in the key store (for example, if you used the generate-certificate-request subcommand to create a certificate signing request and are now importing the signed certificate), then you should use the same alias that is used for the existing private key, and you should provide the complete certificate chain.  When importing a certificate for which the corresponding private key does not already exist in the key store and for which the private key is not being provided by the --private-key-file argument, then the alias must not already exist in the key store, and any provided issuer certificates (which you should provide if they do not already exist in the key store and are not in the JVM's default set of trusted issuer certificates) will be imported with aliases that are generated from the provided alias.  If there is only one issuer certificate to be imported, then it will be stored with an alias that is the provided alias with '-issuer' appended onto it.  If there are multiple issuer certificates to be imported, then their aliases will be the provided alias with '-issuer-#' appended onto it, where '#' will be '1' for the first issuer certificate, '2' for the second, and so on.  This is a required argument.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--certificate-file <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a file containing a certificate or certificate chain to import.  The certificates in the file may be stored either in the text-based PEM or the binary DER format, but if the file contains multiple certificates, then they must all be in the same format.  You may also provide this argument multiple times to specify multiple files containing certificates to import.  However, if multiple certificates are provided, then they must all form a certificate chain in which each subsequent certificate is the issuer certificate for the previous certificate.  When importing a non-self-signed certificate, you should ensure that its issuer certificate is also being imported, is already in the key store under a different alias, or is in the JVM's default set of trusted certificates.  At least one certificate file is required.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--private-key-file <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a file containing the private key for the end certificate in the chain to be imported.  It may be stored in either the text-based PEM or the binary DER format.  This is an optional argument, and at most one private key file may be specified, and that file may contain only a single private key.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--private-key-password <i>{password}</i></tt> &mdash; The password (also called a passphrase or PIN) to use to protect the private key.  This is only needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the key store password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and the key store password will be used as the private key password.  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a password that does not match the key store password, or if you are importing a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password that does not match the key store password, then one of the --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--private-key-password-file <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to a file containing the password to use to protect the private key.  This is only needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the key store password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and the key store password will be used as the private key password.  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a password that does not match the key store password, or if you are importing a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password that does not match the key store password, then one of the --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.  If a private key password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text private key password.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--prompt-for-private-key-password</tt> &mdash; Interactively prompt for the password to use to protect the private key.  This is only needed when importing a private key along with a certificate chain, or when importing a certificate chain into an alias with an existing private key.  In many cases, the private key password will be the same as the key store password and in such instances, the private key password can be omitted and the key store password will be used as the private key password.  However, if you are importing a private key and wish to protect it with a password that does not match the key store password, or if you are importing a new certificate chain for an existing private key that uses a password that does not match the key store password, then one of the --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be provided.

      <li>
        <tt>--inherit-extensions</tt> &mdash; This argument can only be used in conjunction with the --replace-existing-certificate argument, and it indicates that the new certificate should inherit all of the same extension values as the certificate being replaced (although extensions known to apply to the certificate's issuer, like authority key identifier and issuer alternative name, may be excluded).  If the --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided without the --inherit-extensions argument, then the new certificate will only have the extensions that are explicitly specified using other arguments.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

    <p>Generates a certificate signing request (CSR) for a private key in a key store, optionally generating the private key in the process.  The certificate signing request may be either written to standard output or to a specified output file.</p>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--output-format <i>{format}</i></tt> &mdash; The output format to use for the generated certificate signing request.  The value may be either 'PEM' (to export the request in the text-based PEM format), or 'DER' (to export the request in the binary DER format).  If this is not provided, then the PEM output format will be used.

        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the key store file that contains the key (or in which the key will be generated) to use for the certificate signing request.  This is required, but if the file does not exist, then it will be created.

        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-password <i>{password}</i></tt> &mdash; The password (also called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  If the key store does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A key store password is required when generating certificate signing requests, so one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  The password must contain at least six characters.

Although in many cases, private keys will be protected with the same password as the key store itself, it is possible to use a different password for the private key.  If an alternate private key password is needed, then one of the --private-key-password, --private-key-password-file, or --prompt-for-private-key-password arguments should be used to provide that private key password.  If none of these arguments is given, then the key store password will be used as the private key password.  The password must contain at least six characters.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

The value must be one of 'JKS' (for the Java Key Store format), 'PKCS12' (for the standard PKCS #12 format), 'PKCS11' (for PKCS #11 tokens), or 'BCFKS' (for the Bouncy Castle FIPS 140-2-compliant Key Store format).  If this is not provided, then a default key store type of 'JKS' will be used for newly-created key stores.
        <br>
        A provided value should be one of the following:  'pkcs#11', 'pkcs#12', 'jks', 'pkcs11', 'pkcs 11', 'pkcs12', 'pkcs 12', 'pkcs #12', 'bcfks', 'pkcs #11'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--use-existing-key-pair</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the certificate signing request should use an existing key pair in the key store, identified by the specified alias.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--subject-dn <i>{dn}</i></tt> &mdash; The subject DN for the certificate signing request.  This must be provided unless then --replace-existing-certificate argument is given.  If the --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then the --subject-dn argument may be omitted if you want to reuse the same subject as the existing certificate.  A subject DN typically includes at least a 'CN' attribute (which in a server certificate should be the hostname that clients are expected to use when connecting to the server, and in other certificates indicates the purpose of that certificate), and may also include additional attributes like 'OU' (the associated department name), 'O' (the company or organization name), 'L' (the city or locality name), 'ST' (the full name -- NOT the two-letter abbreviation -- of the state or province), 'C' (the two-letter country code -- NOT the full country name).  For example:  'CN=ldap.example.com,OU=Directory Services,O=Example Corporation,L=Austin,ST=Texas,C=US'.
        <br>
        A provided value must be able to be parsed as an LDAP distinguished name as described in RFC 4514.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--key-size-bits <i>{bits}</i></tt> &mdash; The size of the key to generate, in bits.  This argument must not be provided if the --replace-existing-certificate argument is used.  This argument must be provided if the --key-algorithm argument is used to specify an algorithm other than 'RSA'.  If neither this argument nor the --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided, then a default key size of 2048 bits will be used.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than 1 or greater than 2 147 483 647.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--inherit-extensions</tt> &mdash; This argument can only be used in conjunction with the --replace-existing-certificate argument, and it indicates that the requested certificate should inherit all of the same extension values as the certificate being replaced (although extensions known to apply to the certificate's issuer, like authority key identifier and issuer alternative name, may be excluded).  If the --replace-existing-certificate argument is provided without the --inherit-extensions argument, then the new certificate will only have the extensions that are explicitly specified using other arguments.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

If this is not provided, then the current time will be used.  If a value is given, it should be in the form 'YYYYMMDDhhmmss' (for example, '20180102123456').  Timestamp values are assumed to be in the local time zone.
        <br>
        A provided value must be able to be parsed as a valid generalized time (as described in RFC 4517 section 3.1.13) or as a timestamp in the local time zone using any of the formats 'YYYYMMDDhhmmss.uuu', 'YYYYMMDDhhmmss', or 'YYYYMMDDhhmm'.

If this is not provided, then only the extensions requested via command-line arguments will be included in the signed certificate.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

If the key store does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A key store password is required when importing certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  The password must contain at least six characters.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-password-file <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The password (also called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  If the key store does not exist, then it will be created with this password.  A key store password is required when importing certificates, so one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.  If a key store password file is supplied, then the file must exist, must contain only one line, and that line must consist only of the clear-text key store password.  The password must contain at least six characters.

        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-type <i>{type}</i></tt> &mdash; The key store type for the key store to create.  This argument should only be provided when creating a new key store, and it will be ignored if the key store already exists.  The value must be one of 'JKS' (for the Java Key Store format), 'PKCS12' (for the standard PKCS #12 format), 'PKCS11' (for PKCS #11 tokens), or 'BCFKS' (for the Bouncy Castle FIPS 140-2-compliant Key Store format).  If this is not provided, then a default key store type of 'JKS' will be used for newly-created key stores.
        <br>
        A provided value should be one of the following:  'pkcs#11', 'pkcs#12', 'jks', 'pkcs11', 'pkcs 11', 'pkcs12', 'pkcs 12', 'pkcs #12', 'bcfks', 'pkcs #11'.

      <li>
        <tt>--alias <i>{alias}</i></tt> &mdash; The alias (also called a nickname) to use for the first certificate to add to the key store.  This alias must not already be in use in the key store.  If multiple certificates are to be imported, then the first certificate imported will use this alias, and subsequent certificates will have either '-issuer' (if there is only one issuer certificate) or '-issuer-#' (if there are multiple issuers, where # will be replaced with an incrementing number for each subsequent issuer).  If this is omitted, then a default alias will be constructed from the hostname and port number.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--issuers-only</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should only update the key store to include the issuer certificates for the target server, but omit the server certificate at the head of the chain.  This may be useful in environments in which all servers are signed by a common issuer and it is sufficient to trust just the issuer certificates.  This argument will not have any effect for self-signed certificates in which a certificate is its own issuer.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--no-prompt</tt> &mdash; Trust the server certificates without prompting the end user.  By default, the server certificate chain will be displayed and the user will be interactively prompted about whether to trust the certificate.

        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-password <i>{password}</i></tt> &mdash; The password (also called a passphrase or PIN) needed to access the contents of the key store.  A key store password is required, so one of the --keystore-password, --keystore-password-file, or --prompt-for-keystore-password arguments must be provided.

        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--keystore-type <i>{type}</i></tt> &mdash; The key store type for the key store.  This is usually not necessary when checking certificate usability, but it may be required in some cases (for example, when listing the certificates in a BCFKS key store when not operating in FIPS 140-2-compliant mode).  The value must be one of 'JKS' (for the Java Key Store format), 'PKCS12' (for the standard PKCS #12 format), 'PKCS11' (for PKCS #11 tokens), or 'BCFKS' (for the Bouncy Castle FIPS 140-2-compliant Key Store format).

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-sha-1-signature-for-issuer-certificates</tt> &mdash; Do not fail the validation check merely because an issuer certificate contains a signature based on the SHA-1 digest algorithm.  The SHA-1 algorithm is considered weak, and some clients may reject a certificate chain that includes a certificate with a SHA-1-based signature, but because some commercial authorities still use SHA-1-based root certificates, this argument makes it possible to ignore this warning for issuer certificates.
