    <h1>The validate-ldap-schema Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Validate an LDAP schema read from one or more LDIF files.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>validate-ldap-schema <i>{arguments}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Input Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--schema-path <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the schema definitions to parse.  This may be an LDIF file containing a subschema subentry, or it may be a directory containing one or more schema files (in which case the files will be processed in alphabetic order by file name).  This may be provided multiple times if schema definitions should be read from multiple paths (in which case the paths will be processed in they order they were provided on the command line).
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-multiple-entries-per-schema-file</tt> &mdash; Allow schema files to contain multiple entries.  By default, each schema file may contain only a single entry.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-schema-files-in-subdirectories</tt> &mdash; Allow searching for schema files in subdirectories of the provided schema path(s).  This only applies to schema paths that reference directories, and if this argument is provided, then subdirectories will also be examined to look for additional schema files.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Validation Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>--allowed-element-type <i>{elementType}</i></tt> &mdash; A type of schema element that is allowed to be defined in schema files.  This may be provided multiple times if multiple specific element types are allowed.  Allowed values include:  'attribute-syntax', 'matching-rule', 'attribute-type', 'object-class', 'name-form', 'dit-content-rule', 'dit-structure-rule', and 'matching-rule-use'.  If this argument is not provided, then all element types will be allowed.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--prohibited-element-type <i>{elementType}</i></tt> &mdash; A type of schema element that is not permitted to be defined in schema files.  This may be provided multiple times if multiple specific element types are prohibited.  Allowed values include:  'attribute-syntax', 'matching-rule', 'attribute-type', 'object-class', 'name-form', 'dit-content-rule', 'dit-structure-rule', and 'matching-rule-use'.  If this argument is not provided, then no element types will be prohibited.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-redefining-elements</tt> &mdash; Allow a schema element to be defined multiple times.  If this is provided, then subsequent definitions of a schema elements will override previous definitions of the same element.  By default, each schema element may only be defined once.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-undefined-element-type <i>{elementType}</i></tt> &mdash; A type of schema element that may be referenced by an element read from a schema file but that has not been defined in the schema files being read.  This may be provided multiple times if multiple types of undefined elements should be allowed.  Allowed values include:  'attribute-syntax', 'matching-rule', 'attribute-type', 'object-class', 'name-form', 'dit-content-rule', 'dit-structure-rule', and 'matching-rule-use'.  If this argument is not provided, now undefined element types will be allowed, and any reference to an undefined schema element will be reported as an error.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--use-lenient-oid-validation</tt> &mdash; Use lenient validation for numeric object identifiers.  By default, numeric OIDs will be strictly validated.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-non-numeric-oids</tt> &mdash; Allow schema elements to have non-numeric object identifiers.  Although this is technically not valid, some servers allow the use of non-numeric OIDs.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-elements-without-names</tt> &mdash; Allow schema elements to only have OIDs but no names.  Although it is technically valid to have schema elements without names, such elements are not as user-friendly as those with names.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--use-lenient-name-validation</tt> &mdash; Use lenient validation for schema element names.  Valid LDAP schema element names must start with a letter, and must only contain letters, digits, and hyphens, although some servers have more lax name requirements.  If this option is provided, then schema element names will also be permitted to have underscores, and will be permitted to start with any allowed character.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-attribute-types-without-syntax</tt> &mdash; Allow attribute type definitions that do not directly specify a syntax and do not inherit the syntax of a superior attribute type.  Although this is technically not valid, some servers assume a default syntax for such attribute types.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--reject-attribute-types-without-equality-matching-rule</tt> &mdash; Report an error for each attribute type definitions that does not directly specify an equality matching rule and does not inherit an equality matching rule from a superior attribute type.  Although this is technically valid, servers will fall back to byte-for-byte matching for values of such attributes (although some servers may assume a default equality matching rule based on the syntax), which may not be the desired behavior.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-structural-object-classes-without-superior</tt> &mdash; Allow structural object classes that do not superior class.  All structural object classes must specify a superior class, and that superior class must be structural or abstract, but some servers may assume a default superior object class of 'top' for any structural class that does not explicitly specify one.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--reject-object-classes-with-multiple-superiors</tt> &mdash; Reject object classes that have multiple superior classes.  Although this is valid, some servers do not support object classes with multiple superiors.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--allow-empty-descriptions</tt> &mdash; Allow schema elements with an empty string as the value for the 'DESC' element.  LDAP does not allow schema element definitions to contain empty quoted strings, but some servers allow them to have empty descriptions.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
