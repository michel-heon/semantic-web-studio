  Source Connection and Authentication Arguments

    --sourceHostname {host}
        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    --sourcePort {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    --sourceBindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    --sourceBindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    --sourceBindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a

        present to the directory server for SSL client authentication.

        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

Examples

  Migrate all entries at or below 'cn=small subtree,dc=example,dc=com' from

         --sourceBindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com \
         --sourceBindPassword password --targetHostname ds2.example.com \
         --targetPort 389 --targetBindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com \
         --targetBindPassword password \
