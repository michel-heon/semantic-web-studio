Usage for deliver-password-reset-token:

Generate and deliver a single-use token to a user through some out-of-band
mechanism.  The user can provide that token to the password modify extended
request in lieu of the user's current password in order to select a new
password.

Available options include:

  LDAP Connection and Authentication Arguments

    -h, --hostname {host}
        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        bind password.
    -Z, --useSSL
        Use SSL when communicating with the directory server.
    -q, --useStartTLS
        Use StartTLS when communicating with the directory server.
    --defaultTrust
        Use the JVM's default trust store, and optionally an additional trust
        store specified using the --trustStorePath argument, to
        non-interactively determine whether to trust any certificate chain
        presented during TLS negotiation.  If the chain cannot be trusted based
        on any of those sources, then negotiation will fail without prompting
        about whether to trust it.
    -X, --trustAll
        Trust any certificate presented by the directory server.
    -K, --keyStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as the key store for obtaining client
        certificates when communicating securely with the directory server.
    -W, --keyStorePassword {password}

        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the key store contents.
    --keyStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the key store
        file.
    -P, --trustStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as trust store when determining whether to
        trust a certificate presented by the directory server.
    -T, --trustStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the trust store contents.
    -U, --trustStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the trust
        store contents.
    --promptForTrustStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the trust store contents.
    --trustStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the trust store
        file.
    -N, --certNickname {nickname}
        The nickname (alias) of the client certificate in the key store to
        present to the directory server for SSL client authentication.
    --enableSSLDebugging
        Enable Java's low-level support for debugging SSL/TLS communication.
        This is equivalent to setting the 'javax.net.debug' property to 'all'.

        A name-value pair providing information to use when performing SASL
        authentication.
    --useSASLExternal
        Use the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism to authenticate.
    --helpSASL
        Provide information about the supported SASL mechanisms, including the
        properties available for use with each.

  Identification Arguments

  * -b, --userDN {dn}
        The DN of the user to whom the generated password reset token should be
        delivered.

  Delivery Mechanism Arguments

    -m, --deliveryMechanism {name}
        The name of the mechanism that should be used to deliver the password
        reset token to the user.  If multiple values are specified (using
        multiple instances of this argument) then they will be tried in the
        order in which they are given until one of them is able to deliver the
        token.  If this is not specified, then the server configuration will
        dictate which delivery mechanisms should be attempted.
    -s, --messageSubject {subject}
        The subject to use for the message containing the password reset token.
        This will be ignored for delivery mechanisms that do not require a
        subject.
    -f, --fullTextBeforeToken {text}
        The text to include immediately before the password reset token in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that does not impose
        a significant constraint on message size.
    -F, --fullTextAfterToken {text}
        The text to include immediately after the password reset token in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that does not impose
        a significant constraint on message size.
    -c, --compactTextBeforeToken {text}
        The text to include immediately before the password reset token in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that imposes a
        significant constraint on message size.
    -C, --compactTextAfterToken {text}
        The text to include immediately after the password reset token in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that imposes a
        significant constraint on message size.

  Usage Arguments

    --outputFile {path}
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified
        file instead of to the console.
    --appendToOutputFile
        Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the
        --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
        provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
    --teeOutput
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as
        well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must
        also be provided.

    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.

        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

  * Indicates the argument is required

Examples

  'uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' via SMS if possible, or e-mail as
  a second choice.

    deliver-password-reset-token --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=password.admin,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com \

         --userDN uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com \
         --deliveryMechanism SMS --deliveryMechanism E-Mail \
         --messageSubject "Your password reset token" \
         --fullTextBeforeToken "Your single-use password reset token is '" \
         --fullTextAfterToken "'." \
         --compactTextBeforeToken "Your single-use password reset token is '" \
