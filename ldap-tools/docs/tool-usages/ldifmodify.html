    <h1>The ldifmodify Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Apply a set of changes (including add, delete, modify, and modify DN operations) to a set of entries contained in an LDIF file.  The changes will be read from a second file (containing change records rather than entries), and the updated entries will be written to a third LDIF file.  Unlike ldapmodify, the ldifmodify cannot read the changes to apply from standard input.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the change records will be read into memory before processing begins, so it is important to ensure that the tool is given enough memory to hold those change records.  However, it will only operate on a single source entry at a time, so the size of the source LDIF file does not significantly impact the amount of memory that the tool requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the tool will attempt to correctly handle multiple changes affecting the same entry.  However, because it only operates on one entry at a time, it cannot always behave in exactly the same way as if it were applying the changes over LDAP to a server populated with the source LDIF file.  For example, it is not possible to reject an attempt to delete an entry that has subordinates, so any delete will be treated as a subtree delete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, not all types of modify DN change records are supported.  In particular, modify DN change records are not permitted if they target any entry that has been targeted by a previous change record (for example, renaming an entry that was created by a previous add change record).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it cannot perform other types of validation, like ensuring that all of the necessary superior entries exist when adding a new entry, or ensuring that a modify DN will not introduce a conflict with an existing entry.

    <blockquote><pre>ldifmodify <i>{arguments}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Input Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>-s <i>{path}</i></tt> / <tt>--sourceLDIF <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to an LDIF file containing the source entries to be updated.  This argument must be provided exactly once, and the file must exist.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--sourceEncryptionPassphraseFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the file containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the source LDIF file (if it is encrypted).  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the source LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-m <i>{path}</i></tt> / <tt>--changesLDIF <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the file containing the LDIF change records that represent the changes to apply.  This argument must be provided exactly once, and the file must exist.  The entire contents of the file will be read into memory so that all changes will be available when processing entries in the source LDIF file.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--changesEncryptionPassphraseFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the file containing the passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of the changes LDIF file (if it is encrypted).  If this argument is provided, the file must exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only the encryption passphrase.  If the changes LDIF file is encrypted but this argument is not provided, then the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>

        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
