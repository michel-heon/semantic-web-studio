Usage for in-memory-directory-server:

A simple LDAP directory server which holds all of its information in memory and
can be used for basic testing purposes.  It can be created and managed
programmatically using the com.unboundid.ldap.listener.InMemoryDirectoryServer
class.

Usage:  in-memory-directory-server {options}

Available options include:

  Connectivity Arguments

    -p, --port {port}
        The port on which the server should listen for client requests.  If a
        value is specified, then it must be an integer between 1 and 65535.  If
        no port is specified, then the server will automatically select a free
        port to use.
    -Z, --useSSL
        Indicates that the server should encrypt all communication using SSL.
        If this argument is provided, then the '--keyStorePath' and
        '--keyStorePassword' arguments must also be given, and the
        '--useStartTLS' argument must not be given.
    -q, --useStartTLS
        Indicates that the server should support the use of the StartTLS
        extended operation to encrypt all subsequent communication.  If this
        argument is provided, then the '--keyStorePath' and
        '--keyStorePassword' arguments must also be given, and the '--useSSL'
        argument must not be given.
    -K, --keyStorePath {path}
        The path to the Java key store file that will be used to obtain the
        certificate to use for SSL communication.  This may only be provided if
        either the '--useSSL' or '--useStartTLS' argument is also given, and
        cannot be provided if the '--generateSelfSignedCertificate' argument is
        given.
    -W, --keyStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the contents of the SSL key store.  This
        may only be provided if either the '--useSSL' or '--useStartTLS'
        argument is also given.
    --keyStoreType {type}
        The key store type.
    --generateSelfSignedCertificate
        Generate a self-signed certificate instead of using a certificate from
        a key store.  This may only be provided if either the '--useSSL' or
        '--useStartTLS' argument is also given, and cannot be provided if the
        '--keyStorePath' argument is given.
    -P, --trustStorePath {path}
        The path to the Java trust store file that will be used to determine
        whether to trust any client certificates presented to the server.  This
        may only be provided if either the '--useSSL' or '--useStartTLS'
        argument is given, but if SSL or StartTLS is to be used and no trust
        store path is specified, then the server will automatically trust any
        client certificate presented to it.
    -T, --trustStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the contents of the SSL trust store.
        This may only be provided if the '--trustStorePath' argument is also
        given.  If a trust store path is specified but no trust store password
        is given, then the server will attempt to access the trust store
        contents without a password.
    --trustStoreType {type}
        The trust store type.
    --sslClientAuthPolicy {prohibited|optional|required}
        The policy that the server should use for requesting client
        certificates during TLS negotiation.  If this is 'prohibited' (or not
        specified), then the server will not ask clients to present a
        certificate chain.  If this is 'optional', then the server will ask
        clients to present a certificate chain but will continue with TLS
        negotiation if the client does not present one.  If this is 'required',
        then the server will ask clients to present a certificate chain and
        will abort TLS negotiation if the client does not present one.
    --maxConcurrentConnections {value}
        The maximum number of concurrent connections that the server will allow
        at any time.  If this is not provided, then the server will not impose
        any limit on the number of concurrent connections.

  Data Arguments

  * -b, --baseDN {baseDN}
        The base DN to use for the server.  Only entries at or below one of the
        defined base DNs may be created in the server.  At least one base DN
        must be defined, but multiple base DNs may be specified as separate
        arguments.
    -l, --ldifFile {path}
        The path to an LDIF file containing an initial set of data to use to
        populate the server.  If this is not provided, then the server will
        initially be empty.
    -D, --additionalBindDN {bindDN}
        An additional DN that may be used to bind to the server even if the
        specified user does not exist in the data set.  If this is provided,
        then the '--additionalBindPassword' argument must also be given.
    -w, --additionalBindPassword {password}
        The password that should be used to authenticate when using the DN
        specified with the '--additionalBindDN' argument.
    -s, --useDefaultSchema
        Indicates that the server should use a default set of standard schema.
    -S, --useSchemaFile {path}
        The path to a file or directory containing schema definitions to use
        for the server.  If the path specified is a file, then it must be an
        LDIF file containing a single entry that is a valid LDAP subschema
        subentry.  If the path specified is a directory, then any files
        contained in it will be examined in lexicographic order by name to
        create an aggregate schema.
    --doNotValidateSchemaDefinitions
        Do not attempt to validate any custom schema definitions provided using
        the --useSchemaFile argument.  By default, the server will examine
        custom schema definitions and report any issues that it identifies.
        Note that even if the server does identify one or more issues with the
        provided schema, it will still attempt to use that schema to the best
        of its ability.
    --doNotGenerateOperationalAttributes,
    --do-not-generate-operational-attributes
        Do not automatically maintain any operational attributes (including
        entryDN, entryUUID, subschemaSubentry, creatorsName, createTimestamp,
        modifiersName, and modifyTimestamp) in entries.
    -I, --equalityIndex {attr}
        Maintain an equality index for the specified attribute.  The server
        must be configured to use a schema (which may optionally be the default
        standard schema), and the specified attribute type must be defined in
        the schema.
    -c, --maxChangeLogEntries {count}
        The maximum number of LDAP changelog entries that should be maintained
        by the server.  If this is not provided, then the server will not
        maintain a changelog.
    --sizeLimit {value}
        The maximum number of entries that the server may return to a single
        search request.  If this is not provided, then the server will not
        impose any size limit for search operations.
    --passwordAttribute {attr}
        The name or OID of an attribute type that will hold user passwords for
        authentication.  If this is not provided, then a default of
        'userPassword' will be used.  This may be provided multiple times to
        specify multiple password attributes.
    --defaultPasswordEncoding {scheme}
        The default scheme that should be used for encoding new passwords.
        Allowed values include MD5, SMD5, SHA, SSHA, SHA256, SSHA256, SHA384,

        add, bind, compare, delete, extended, modify, modify-dn, and search.
        This may be provided multiple times to specify multiple allowed
        operation types.  If this is not provided, then all types of operations
        will be allowed.
    --authenticationRequiredOperationType {type}
        A type of operation that the server will only allow on connections that
        are authenticated.  Allowed values include add, compare, delete,
        extended, modify, modify-dn, and search.  This may be provided multiple
        times to specify multiple authentication required operation types.  If
        this is not provided, then authentication will not be required for any
        type of operation.
    --vendorName {value}
        The value to include in the vendorName argument of the server root
        DSE.

Examples

  Creates an initially-empty directory server instance listening on an
  automatically-selected port that will allow entries below 'dc=example,dc=com'
  and will not perform any logging or schema validation.

    in-memory-directory-server --baseDN dc=example,dc=com

  Creates a directory server instance listening on port 1389 that is initially
  populated with the data from the file test.ldif and will allow only entries
  below 'dc=example,dc=com'.  It will write a record of operations processed to
  file access.log and will use a default set of standard schema definitions.

    in-memory-directory-server --baseDN dc=example,dc=com --port 1389 \
         --ldifFile test.ldif --accessLogFile access.log --useDefaultSchema
