Usage for identify-unique-attribute-conflicts:

This tool may be used to identify unique attribute conflicts.  That is, it may
identify values of one or more attributes which are supposed to exist only in a
single entry but are found in multiple entries.

Usage:  identify-unique-attribute-conflicts {options}

Available options include:

  LDAP Connection and Authentication Arguments

    -h, --hostname {host}
        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        bind password.
    -Z, --useSSL
        Use SSL when communicating with the directory server.
    -q, --useStartTLS
        Use StartTLS when communicating with the directory server.
    --defaultTrust
        Use the JVM's default trust store, and optionally an additional trust
        store specified using the --trustStorePath argument, to
        non-interactively determine whether to trust any certificate chain
        presented during TLS negotiation.  If the chain cannot be trusted based
        on any of those sources, then negotiation will fail without prompting
        about whether to trust it.
    -X, --trustAll
        Trust any certificate presented by the directory server.
    -K, --keyStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as the key store for obtaining client
        certificates when communicating securely with the directory server.
    -W, --keyStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the key store contents.
    -u, --keyStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the key
        store contents.
    --promptForKeyStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the key store contents.
    --keyStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the key store
        file.
    -P, --trustStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as trust store when determining whether to
        trust a certificate presented by the directory server.
    -T, --trustStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the trust store contents.
    -U, --trustStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the trust
        store contents.
    --promptForTrustStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the trust store contents.
    --trustStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the trust store
        file.
    -N, --certNickname {nickname}
        The nickname (alias) of the client certificate in the key store to
        present to the directory server for SSL client authentication.
    --enableSSLDebugging
        Enable Java's low-level support for debugging SSL/TLS communication.
        This is equivalent to setting the 'javax.net.debug' property to 'all'.
    -o, --saslOption {name=value}
        A name-value pair providing information to use when performing SASL
        authentication.
    --useSASLExternal
        Use the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism to authenticate.
    --helpSASL
        Provide information about the supported SASL mechanisms, including the
        properties available for use with each.

  Other Arguments

  * -b, --baseDN {dn}
        The search base DN(s) to use to find entries with attributes for which
        to find uniqueness conflicts.  At least one base DN must be specified.
    -f, --filter {filter}
        A filter that will be used to identify the set of entries in which to
        identify uniqueness conflicts.  If this is not specified, then all
        entries containing the target attribute(s) will be examined.
  * -A, --attribute {attr}
        The attributes for which to find uniqueness conflicts.  At least one
        attribute must be specified, and each attribute must be indexed for
        equality searches.
    -m, --multipleAttributeBehavior {behavior}
        Indicates the behavior to exhibit if multiple unique attributes are
        provided.  Allowed values are 'unique-within-each-attribute' (indicates
        that each value only needs to be unique within its own attribute type),
        'unique-across-all-attributes-including-in-same-entry' (indicates that
        each value needs to be unique across all of the specified attributes),
        'unique-across-all-attributes-except-in-same-entry' (indicates each
        value needs to be unique across all of the specified attributes, except
        that multiple attributes in the same entry are allowed to share the
        same value), and 'unique-in-combination' (indicates that every
        combination of the values of the specified attributes must be unique
        across each entry).
    -z, --simplePageSize {num}
        The maximum number of entries to retrieve at a time when attempting to
        find uniqueness conflicts.  This requires that the authenticated user
        have permission to use the simple paged results control, but it can
        avoid problems with the server sending entries too quickly for the
        client to handle.  By default, the simple paged results control will
        not be used.
    -l, --timeLimitSeconds {num}
        The time limit in seconds that will be used for search requests
        attempting to identify conflicts for each value of any of the unique
        attributes.  This time limit is used to avoid sending expensive
        unindexed search requests that can consume significant server
        resources.  If any of these search operations fails in a way that
        indicates the requested time limit was exceeded, the tool will abort
        its processing.  A value of zero indicates that no time limit will be
        enforced.  If this argument is not provided, a default time limit of 10
        will be used.

  Usage Arguments

    --appendToOutputFile
        Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the
        --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
        provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
    --teeOutput
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as

        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.

    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.
