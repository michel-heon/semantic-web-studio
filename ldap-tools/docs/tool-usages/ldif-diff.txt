Usage for ldif-diff:

Compare the contents of two files containing LDIF entries.  The output will be
an LDIF file containing the add, delete, and modify change records needed to
convert the data in the source LDIF file into the data in the target LDIF file.

This tool works best with small LDIF files because it reads the entire contents
of the source and target LDIF files into memory so they can be quickly
compared.  If you encounter an out of memory error while running the tool, you
may need to increase the amount of memory available to the JVM used to invoke
it.

The amount of memory available to the JVM may be customized by invoking the JVM
with the '-Xms' and '-Xmx' arguments (which specify the initial and maximum
amounts of memory that it may use, respectively).  These arguments should be
immediately followed (without any intervening space) by an integer and a unit
to specify the amount of memory that may be used.  The unit may be either 'm'
to indicate that the size is in megabytes, or 'g' to indicate that it is in
gigabytes.  For example, '-Xms512m' indicates that the JVM should be given an
initial heap size of 512 megabytes, while '-Xmx2g' indicates that it should be
given a maximum heap size of two gigabytes.

When invoking the ldif-diff tool with the shell script or batch file included
as part of the LDAP SDK, you may use the 'JAVA_ARGS' environment variable to
specify the arguments to use when invoking the JVM.

Usage:  ldif-diff {options}

Available options include:

  Source LDIF Arguments

  * -s, --sourceLDIF {path}
        The path to the LDIF file containing the entries to use as the source
        data set.  This argument must be specified, and the source LDIF file
        must exist.  The LDIF file may optionally be gzip-compressed and/or
        passphrase-encrypted.
    --sourceEncryptionPassphraseFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the passphrase used to encrypt the
        contents of the source LDIF file.  If this argument is provided, the
        file must exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only
        the encryption passphrase.  If the source LDIF file is encrypted but
        this argument is not provided, then the tool will interactively prompt
        for the passphrase.

  Target LDIF Arguments

  * -t, --targetLDIF {path}
        The path to the LDIF file containing the entries to use as the target
        data set.  This argument must be specified, and the target LDIF file
        must exist.  The LDIF file may optionally be gzip-compressed and/or
        passphrase-encrypted.
    --targetEncryptionPassphraseFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the passphrase used to encrypt the
        contents of the target LDIF file.  If this argument is provided, the
        file must exist and must contain exactly one line that contains only
        the encryption passphrase.  If the target LDIF file is encrypted but
        this argument is not provided, then the tool will interactively prompt
        for the passphrase.

  Output LDIF Arguments

    -o, --outputLDIF {path}
        The path to the LDIF file to which the resulting LDIF add, delete, and
        modify change records will be written.  If this file already exists,
        then the new LDIF records will be appended to it unless the
        '--overwriteExisting' argument is provided.  If this file does not
        exist, then the parent directory must exist.  If this argument is not
        provided, then the changes will be written to standard output.
    --compressOutput
        GZIP-compress the data as it is written to the output file.
    --encryptOutput
        Encrypt the data as it is written to the output file.  If the
        '--outputEncryptionPassphraseFile' argument is provided, then the
        passphrase contained in that file will be used to encrypt the output.
        Otherwise, the tool will interactively prompt for the passphrase.
    --outputEncryptionPassphraseFile {path}
        The path to a file containing the passphrase to use to encrypt the
        contents of the output file.  If this argument is provided, then the
        file must exist, and it must contain exactly one line comprised
        entirely of the encryption passphrase.
    -O, --overwriteExistingOutputLDIF
        Overwrite the output file if it already exists, rather than appending
        to it.  This argument must be provided if the output file already
        exists and either of the '--compressOutput' or '--encryptOutput'
        arguments is provided.

  Content Arguments

    --changeType {add|delete|modify}
        The type of change to include in the output.  Allowed values are 'add'
        (to indicate that the output should include LDIF add change records for
        all entries that are present in the target LDIF but not in the source),
        'delete' (to indicate that the output should include LDIF delete change
        records for all entries that are present in the source LDIF but not in
        the target), and 'modify' (to indicate that the output should include
        LDIF modify change records for all entries that are present in both the
        source and target LDIF files but that differ between the two versions).
        This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple change
        types.  By default, all change types will be included.
    --includeFilter {filter}
        Only include changes to entries that match the given filter (either
        before or after the change).  This argument may be provided multiple
        times to specify multiple include filters (in which case an entry will
        only be included if it matches at least one of the provided filters).
    --excludeFilter {filter}
        Exclude changes to entries that match the given filter (either before
        or after the change).  This argument may be provided multiple times to
        specify multiple exclude filters (in which case an entry will be
        excluded if it matches any of the provided filters).
    --includeAttribute {attributeName}
        Only include the specified attribute in the change records that are
        written.  Changes that do not affect the specified attribute will be
        omitted from the results.  This argument may be provided multiple times
        to specify multiple include attributes.
    --excludeAttribute {attributeName}
        Exclude the specified attribute from the change records that are
        written.  Changes that affect only the specified attribute will be
        omitted from the results.  This argument may be provided multiple times
        to specify multiple exclude attributes.
    -i, --includeOperationalAttributes
        Include operational attributes in the output file, in both add and
        modify change records.  By default, only user attributes will be
        included.
    -e, --excludeNoUserModificationAttributes
        Exclude operational attributes declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION
        constraint.  This argument is only applicable if the
        '--includeOperationalAttributes' argument is provided.
    --nonReversibleModifications
        Generate modify change records in non-reversible form, in which
        attribute differences are written with the 'replace' modification type.
        By default, modifications will be generated in reversible form, with
        delete modifications to remove existing values that are no longer
        included and add modifications to insert new values.  Using reversible
        form is generally considered safer, as attempts to apply the
        modifications are more likely to fail if the entry has been updated.
        Modifications generated in non-reversible form are more likely to
        succeed when applied, but at a greater risk of losing changes that have
        been processed since the LDIF files were generated.
    --stripTrailingSpaces
        Strip off any illegal trailing spaces identified in LDIF entries rather
        than rejecting those entries.

  Other Arguments

    -S, --singleValueChanges
        Generate a separate modify change record for each attribute value that
        is to be removed from or added to the target entry.  By default, all
        modifications to an entry will be provided in a single modify change
        record.  If a separate modify change record is generated for each
        attribute value, it may be easier to apply changes if the data set has
        changed since the LDIF files were generated (by instructing the tool
        that is applying changes to ignore failures).
    --schemaPath {path}
        The path to an LDIF file (or a directory containing multiple LDIF
        files) with the schema definitions to use during processing.  This
        argument may be used multiple times to specify multiple schema paths.
        If this argument is ot provided, the LDAP SDK's default standard schema
        will be used.

  Usage Arguments

    --interactive
        Launch the tool in interactive mode.
    -H, --help
        Display usage information for this program.
    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.
    --propertiesFilePath {path}
        The path to a properties file used to specify default values for
        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

  * Indicates the argument is required

Examples

  Identify the changes needed to transform the set of entries contained in the
  'actual.ldif' file into the set of entries contained in the 'desired.ldif'
  file.  Operational attributes will be ignored, and modifications will be
  presented in reversible form.

    ldif-diff --sourceLDIF actual.ldif --targetLDIF desired.ldif \
         --outputLDIF diff.ldif

  Identify the changes needed to transform the set of entries contained in the
  'actual.ldif' file into the set of entries contained in the 'desired.ldif'
  file.  Operational attributes not declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION will
  be included, and modifications will be presented in non-reversible form.

    ldif-diff --sourceLDIF actual.ldif --targetLDIF desired.ldif \
         --outputLDIF diff.ldif --includeOperationalAttributes \
