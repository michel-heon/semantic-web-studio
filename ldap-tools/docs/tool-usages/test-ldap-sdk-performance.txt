Usage for test-ldap-sdk-performance:

Provides a mechanism to help test the performance of the LDAP SDK.

It creates an LDAP listener that uses a canned-response request handler to
return a predefined response to all requests.  Itthen invokes another tool
(either searchrate, modrate, authrate, or search-and-mod-rate) to issue
concurrent requests against that listener as quickly as possible.

Usage:  test-ldap-sdk-performance {options}

Available options include:
--tool {searchrate|modrate|authrate|search-and-mod-rate}
    The tool to invoke against the LDAP listener.  It may be one of searchrate,
    modrate, authrate, or search-and-mod-rate.  If this is not provided, then
    the searchrate tool will be invoked.
-t, --numThreads {num}
    The number of concurrent threads (each using its own connection) to use to
    process requests.  If this is not provided, then a single thread will be
    used.
--entriesPerSearch {num}
    The number of entries to return in response to each search request.  If
    this is provided, the value must be between 0 and 100.  If it is not
    provided, then a single entry will be returned.
--bindOnly
    Indicates that the authrate tool should only issue bind requests.  If this
    is not provided, the authrate tool will perform both search and bind
    operations.  This argument will only be used in conjunction with the
    authrate tool.
--resultCode {intValue}
    The integer value for the result code to return in response to each
    request.  If this is not provided, then a result code of 0 (success) will
    be returned.
--diagnosticMessage {message}
    The diagnostic message to return in response to each request.  If this is
    not provided, then no diagnostic message will be returned.
-Z, --useSSL
    Encrypt communication with SSL.  If this argument is not provided, then the
    communication will not be encrypted.
-I, --numIntervals {num}
    The number of intervals to use when running the performance measurement
    tool.  If this argument is provided in conjunction with the
    --warmUpIntervals argument, then the warm-up intervals will not be included
    in this count, and the total number of intervals run will be the sum of the
    two values.  If this argument is not provided, then the tool will run until
    it is interrupted (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C or by killing the underlying
    Java process).
-i, --intervalDurationSeconds {num}
    The length of time in seconds to use for each tool interval (that is, the
    length of time between each line of output giving statistical information
    for operations processed in that interval).  If this is not provided, then
    a default interval duration of five seconds will be used.
--warmUpIntervals {num}
    The number of intervals to run before starting to actually collect
    statistics to include in the final result.  This can give the JVM and JIT a
    chance to identify and optimize hotspots in the code for the best and most
    stable performance.  If this is not provided, then no warm-up intervals
    will be used and the tool will start collecting statistics right away.
--interactive
    Launch the tool in interactive mode.
--outputFile {path}
    Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified file
    instead of to the console.
--appendToOutputFile
    Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the
    --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
    provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
--teeOutput
    Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as
    well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must also
    be provided.
-H, --help
    Display usage information for this program.
-V, --version
    Display version information for this program.
--propertiesFilePath {path}
    The path to a properties file used to specify default values for arguments
    not supplied on the command line.
--generatePropertiesFile {path}
    Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default values
    for arguments.
--noPropertiesFile
    Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
--suppressPropertiesFileComment
    Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

Examples

  Test LDAP SDK performance with the searchrate tool using ten concurrent
  threads.  Communication will use an insecure connection, and each search will
  return a success result with a single matching entry.  The tool will continue
  to run until it is interrupted.

    test-ldap-sdk-performance --numThreads 10

  Test LDAP SDK performance with the modrate tool using ten concurrent threads
  over SSL-encrypted connections.  Each modify will return an error result with
  a result code of 32 (noSuchObject) and a diagnostic message of 'The target
  entry does not exist'.  The tool will run five warm-up intervals of five
  seconds each, and then ten 5-second intervals in which it will capture
  statistics.  The tool will exit after those last ten intervals have
  completed.

    test-ldap-sdk-performance --tool modrate --numThreads 10 --useSSL \
         --resultCode 32 --diagnosticMessage "The base entry does not exist" \
         --warmUpIntervals 5 --numIntervals 10 --intervalDurationSeconds 5
