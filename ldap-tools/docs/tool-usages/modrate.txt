        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the

  Modification Arguments

  * -b, --entryDN {dn}
        The DN of the entry to modify.  It may be a simple DN or a value
        pattern to specify a range of DN (e.g.,
        "uid=user.[1-1000],ou=People,dc=example,dc=com").  See
        https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html?com/unboundid/ut
        il/ValuePattern.html for complete details about the value pattern
        syntax.  This must be provided.
  * -A, --attribute {name}
        The name of the attribute to modify.  Multiple attributes may be
        specified by providing this argument multiple times.  At least one
        attribute must be specified.
    --valuePattern {pattern}
        The pattern to use to generate values for the replace modifications.
        If this is provided, then neither the --valueLength argument nor the
        --characterSet arguments may be provided.
    -l, --valueLength {num}
        The length in bytes to use when generating values for the replace
        modifications.  If this is not provided, then a default length of ten
        bytes will be used.
    --valueCount {num}
        The number of values to include in replace modifications.  If this is
        not provided, then a default of one value will be used.
    --increment
        Indicates that the tool should use the increment modification type
        rather than the replace modification type.
    --incrementAmount {value}
        The amount by which to increment values when using the increment
        modification type.  The amount may be negative if values should be
        decremented rather than incremented.  If this is not provided, then a
        default increment amount of one will be used.
    -C, --characterSet {chars}
        The set of characters to use to generate the values for the
        modifications.  It should only include ASCII characters.  If this is
        not provided, then a default set of lowercase alphabetic characters
        will be used.

  Request Control Arguments

    --assertionFilter {filter}
        Indicates that modify requests should include the assertion request
        control with the specified filter.
    --permissiveModify
        Indicates that modify requests should include the permissive modify
        request control.
    --preReadAttribute {attribute}
        Indicates that modify requests should include the pre-read request
        control with the specified requested attribute.  This argument may be
        provided multiple times to indicate that multiple requested attributes
        should be included in the pre-read request control.
    --postReadAttribute {attribute}
        Indicates that modify requests should include the post-read request
        control with the specified requested attribute.  This argument may be
        provided multiple times to indicate that multiple requested attributes
        should be included in the post-read request control.
    -Y, --proxyAs {authzID}
        Indicates that the proxied authorization control (as defined in RFC
        4370) should be used to request that operations be processed using an
        alternate authorization identity.  This may be a simple authorization
        ID or it may be a value pattern to specify a range of identities.  See
        https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html?com/unboundid/ut
        il/ValuePattern.html for complete details about the value pattern

        control.  This may be provided multiple times to include multiple
        request controls.

  Rate Management Arguments

    -t, --numThreads {num}
        The number of threads to use to perform the modifications.  If this is
        not provided, a single thread will be used.
    -i, --intervalDuration {num}
        The length of time in seconds between output lines.  If this is not
        provided, then a default interval of five seconds will be used.
    -I, --numIntervals {num}

        provided, then the tool will run until it is interrupted.
    --iterationsBeforeReconnect {num}
        The number of modify iterations that should be processed on a
        connection before that connection is closed and replaced with a
        newly-established (and authenticated, if appropriate) connection.  If
        this is not provided, then connections will not be periodically closed
        and re-established.
    -r, --ratePerSecond {modifies-per-second}
        The target number of modifies to perform per second.  It is still
        necessary to specify a sufficient number of threads for achieving this
        rate.  If neither this option nor --variableRateData is provided, then
        the tool will run at the maximum rate for the specified number of
        threads.
    --variableRateData {path}
        The path to a file containing information that can be used to cause the
        tool to vary the target rate over time.  Use the generateSampleRateFile
        argument to generate a sample rate definition file with comments that
        describe the required format for this file.
    --generateSampleRateFile {path}
        The path to a sample variable data rate file that should be generated.
        This file will contain comments that describe the expected format for
        the file to use with the variableRateData argument.
    --warmUpIntervals {num}
        The number of intervals to complete before beginning overall statistics
        collection.  Specifying a nonzero number of warm-up intervals gives the
        client and server a chance to warm up without skewing performance
        results.

  Other Arguments

    --timestampFormat {format}
        Indicates the format to use for timestamps included in the output.  A
        value of 'none' indicates that no timestamps should be included.  A
        value of 'with-date' indicates that both the date and the time should
        be included.  A value of 'without-date' indicates that only the time
        should be included.
    --suppressErrorResultCodes
        Indicates that information about the result codes for failed operations
        should not be displayed.
    -c, --csv
        Generate output in CSV format rather than a display-friendly format
    -R, --randomSeed {value}
        Specifies the seed to use for the random number generator.

        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

Examples

  Test modify performance by randomly selecting entries across a set of one
  million users located below 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' with ten concurrent
  threads and replacing the values for the description attribute with a string
  of 12 randomly-selected lowercase alphabetic characters.

    modrate --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com --bindPassword password \
         --entryDN "uid=user.[1-1000000],ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" \
         --attribute description --valueLength 12 --numThreads 10

  Generate a sample variable rate definition file that may be used in
  conjunction with the --variableRateData argument.  The sample file will
  include comments that describe the format for data to be included in this
  file.
