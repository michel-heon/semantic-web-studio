        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a

  Search Arguments

    -b, --baseDN {dn}
        The base DN to use for the searches.  It may be a simple DN or a value
        pattern to specify a range of DNs (e.g.,
        "uid=user.[1-1000],ou=People,dc=example,dc=com").  See
        https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html?com/unboundid/ut
        il/ValuePattern.html for complete details about the value pattern
        syntax.  This argument must not be used in conjunction with the
        --ldapURL argument.
    -s, --scope {scope}
        The scope to use for the searches.  It should be 'base', 'one', 'sub',
        or 'subord'.  If this is not provided, then a default scope of 'sub'
        will be used.  This argument must not be used in conjunction with the
        --ldapURL argument.
    -f, --filter {filter}
        The filter to use for the searches.  It may be a simple filter or a
        value pattern to specify a range of filters (e.g.,
        "(uid=user.[1-1000])").  See
        https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html?com/unboundid/ut
        il/ValuePattern.html for complete details about the value pattern
        syntax.  Exactly one of this argument and the --ldapURL arguments must
        be provided.
    -A, --attribute {name}
        The name of an attribute to include in entries returned from the
        searches.  Multiple attributes may be requested by providing this
        argument multiple times.  If no request attributes are provided, then
        the entries returned will include all user attributes.  This argument
        must not be used in conjunction with the --ldapURL argument.
    --ldapURL {url}
        An LDAP URL that provides the base DN, scope, filter, and requested
        attributes to use for the search requests (the address and port
        components of the URL, if present, will be ignored).  It may be a
        simple LDAP URL or a value pattern to specify a range of URLs.  See
        https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html?com/unboundid/ut
        il/ValuePattern.html for complete details about the value pattern
        syntax.  If this argument is provided, then none of the --baseDN,
        --scope, --filter, or --attribute arguments may be used.
    -z, --sizeLimit {num}
        The maximum number of entries that the server should return in response
        to each search request.  A value of zero indicates that the client does
        not wish to impose any limit on the number of entries that are returned
        (although the server may impose its own limit).  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of zero will be used.
    -l, --timeLimitSeconds {seconds}
        The maximum length of time, in seconds, that the server should spend
        processing each search request.  A value of zero indicates that the
        client does not wish to impose any limit on the server's processing
        time (although the server may impose its own limit).  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of zero will be used.
    --dereferencePolicy {never|always|search|find}
        The alias dereferencing policy to use for search requests.  The value
        should be one of 'never', 'always', 'search', or 'find'.  If this is
        not provided, then a default value of 'never' will be used.
    --typesOnly
        Indicates that server should only include the names of the attributes
        contained in matching entries rather than both names and values.

  Request Control Arguments

    --assertionFilter {filter}
        Indicates that search requests should include the assertion request
        control with the specified filter.
    --simplePageSize {size}
        Indicates that search requests should include the simple paged results
        control with the specified page size.
    --sortOrder {sortOrder}
        Indicates that search requests should include the server-side sort
        request control with the specified sort order.  This should be a
        comma-delimited list in which each item is an attribute name,
        optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign (to indicate ascending or
        descending order; where ascending order is the default), and optionally
        followed by a colon and the name or OID of the desired ordering
        matching rule (if this is not provided, the the attribute type's
        default ordering rule will be used).
    -Y, --proxyAs {authzID}
        Indicates that the proxied authorization control (as defined in RFC
        4370) should be used to request that operations be processed using an
        alternate authorization identity.  This may be a simple authorization
        ID or it may be a value pattern to specify a range of identities.  See
        https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html?com/unboundid/ut
        il/ValuePattern.html for complete details about the value pattern
        syntax.
    -J, --control {oid}[:{criticality}[:{stringValue}|::{base64Value}]]
        Indicates that search requests should include the specified request
        control.  This may be provided multiple times to include multiple
        request controls.

  Rate Management Arguments

    -t, --numThreads {num}
        The number of threads to use to perform the searches.  If this is not
        provided, then a default of one thread will be used.
    -i, --intervalDuration {num}
        The length of time in seconds between output lines.  If this is not
        provided, then a default interval of five seconds will be used.
    -I, --numIntervals {num}
        The maximum number of intervals for which to run.  If this is not
        provided, then the tool will run until it is interrupted.
    --iterationsBeforeReconnect {num}
        The number of search iterations that should be processed on a
        connection before that connection is closed and replaced with a
        newly-established (and authenticated, if appropriate) connection.  If
        this is not provided, then connections will not be periodically closed
        and re-established.
    -r, --ratePerSecond {searches-per-second}
        The target number of searches to perform per second.  It is still
        necessary to specify a sufficient number of threads for achieving this
        rate.  If neither this option nor --variableRateData is provided, then
        the tool will run at the maximum rate for the specified number of
        threads.
    --variableRateData {path}
        The path to a file containing information that can be used to cause the
        tool to vary the target rate over time.  Use the generateSampleRateFile
        argument to generate a sample rate definition file with comments that
        describe the required format for this file.
    --generateSampleRateFile {path}
        The path to a sample variable data rate file that should be generated.
        This file will contain comments that describe the expected format for
        the file to use with the variableRateData argument.
    --warmUpIntervals {num}
        The number of intervals to complete before beginning overall statistics
        collection.  Specifying a nonzero number of warm-up intervals gives the
        client and server a chance to warm up without skewing performance
        results.

  Other Arguments

    --timestampFormat {format}
        Indicates the format to use for timestamps included in the output.  A
        value of 'none' indicates that no timestamps should be included.  A
        value of 'with-date' indicates that both the date and the time should
        be included.  A value of 'without-date' indicates that only the time
        should be included.
    -a, --asynchronous
        Indicates that the client should operate in asynchronous mode, in which
        it will not be necessary to wait for a response to a previous request
        before sending the next request.  Either the '--ratePerSecond' or the
        '--maxOutstandingRequests' argument must be provided to limit the
        number of outstanding requests.
    -O, --maxOutstandingRequests {num}
        Specifies the maximum number of outstanding requests that should be
        allowed when operating in asynchronous mode.
    --suppressErrorResultCodes
        Indicates that information about the result codes for failed operations
        should not be displayed.
    -c, --csv
        Generate output in CSV format rather than a display-friendly format
    -R, --randomSeed {value}
        Specifies the seed to use for the random number generator.

  Usage Arguments

        Launch the tool in interactive mode.
    --outputFile {path}
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified
        file instead of to the console.
    --appendToOutputFile
        Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the
        --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
        provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
    --teeOutput
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as
        well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must
        also be provided.
    -H, --help
        Display usage information for this program.
    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.
    --propertiesFilePath {path}
        The path to a properties file used to specify default values for
        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

Examples

  Test search performance by searching randomly across a set of one million
  users located below 'dc=example,dc=com' with ten concurrent threads.  The
  entries returned to the client will include the givenName, sn, and mail
  attributes.

    searchrate --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com --bindPassword password \
         --baseDN dc=example,dc=com --scope sub \
         --filter "(uid=user.[1-1000000])" --attribute givenName \
         --attribute sn --attribute mail --numThreads 10

  Generate a sample variable rate definition file that may be used in
  conjunction with the --variableRateData argument.  The sample file will
  include comments that describe the format for data to be included in this
  file.

    searchrate --generateSampleRateFile variable-rate-data.txt
