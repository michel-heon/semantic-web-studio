    <h1>The manage-account Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Retrieve or update information about the current state of a user account.  Processing will be performed using the password policy state extended operation, and you must have the password-reset privilege to use this extended operation.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>manage-account <i>{subCommand}</i> <i>{arguments}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      This tool uses subcommands to indicate which function you want to perform.

      <li>
        <tt>-z <i>{value}</i></tt> / <tt>--simplePageSize <i>{value}</i></tt> &mdash; Indicates that any searches performed to identify which users to target should make use of the simple paged results control to cause the entries to be returned in sets of no more than the specified number of entries.  When processing searches that may return a large number of entries, setting a page size can help reduce the likelihood that the server will need to block while sending results to the client if matching entries are identified much more quickly than the client can process the desired manage-account operations against those entries.  Further, when performing searches that may return a large number of entries, and especially for unindexed searches, setting a page size can help the client more efficiently resume processing in the event that the connection used to process the search becomes unusable.
