Usage for ldapdelete:

Delete one or more entries from an LDAP directory server.  You can provide the
DNs of the entries to delete using named arguments, as trailing arguments, from
a file, or from standard input.  Alternatively, you can identify entries to
delete using a search base DN and filter.

Usage:  ldapdelete {options} [{dn1} [{dn2} [{dn3} ...] ] ]

Available options include:

  Data Arguments

    -b, --entryDN {dn}
        The DN of an entry to delete.  This argument may be provided multiple
        times to specify the DNs of multiple entries to delete, and entries
        will be deleted in the order in which the arguments were given.  This
        argument must not be used in conjunction with any other argument used
        to indicate which entries should be deleted.
    -f, --dnFile {path}
        The path to a file containing the DNs of the entries to delete.  Each
        DN must be on its own line in the file, with blank lines and lines
        starting with the '#' character being ignored.  Each DN line may
        optionally start with 'dn:' (or 'dn::' to indicate that the DN is
        base64-encoded), and long DNs may be wrapped across multiple lines by
        starting subsequent lines with at least one space.  This argument may
        be provided multiple times to specify multiple DN files, and the files
        will be processed in the order they were provided.  This argument must
        not be used in conjunction with any other argument used to indicate
        which entries should be deleted.
    --deleteEntriesMatchingFilter {filter}
        An LDAP search filter that can be used to identify the entries to
        delete.  The base DN for the searches should be specified using the
        --searchBaseDN argument, with the null DN being used by default if that
        argument is not given.  This argument may be provided multiple times to
        specify multiple filters, and searches will be performed in the order
        in which the filters are provided.  This argument must not be used in
        conjunction with any other argument used to indicate which entries
        should be deleted.
    --deleteEntriesMatchingFiltersFromFile {path}
        The path to a file containing LDAP search filters (one filter per line,
        with blank lines and lines starting with the '#' character being
        ignored) that can be used to identify the entries to delete.  The base
        DN for the searches should be specified using the --searchBaseDN
        argument, with the null DN being used by default if that argument is
        not given.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify the
        paths to multiple filter files, and the files will be processed in the
        order they are provided on the command line.  This argument must not be
        used in conjunction with any other argument used to indicate which
        entries should be deleted.
    --searchBaseDN {dn}
        The base DN to use when searching for entries to delete.  This argument
        may only be used in conjunction with the --deleteEntriesMatchingFilter
        or --deleteEntriesMatchingFiltersFromFile arguments.  It may be
        provided multiple times to specify multiple search base DNs.  If this
        argument is not given, the null DN will be used as the base DN for the
        searches.
    --searchPageSize {value}
        The page size to use in conjunction with the simple paged results
        control when retrieving entries.  This argument may be used in
        conjunction with either the --deleteEntriesMatchingFilter or the
        --deleteEntriesMatchingFilterFromFile argument to indicate that the
        search should use the simple paged results control to retrieve the
        entries in pages rather than all at once.  It may also be used in
        conjunction with the --clientSideSubtreeDelete argument to indicate the
        page size for the simple paged results control that it uses.
    --encryptionPassphraseFile {path}
        The path to a file containing the passphrase used to encrypt an input
        file.  If this is not provided and an input file is encrypted (and the
        encryption key cannot be automatically obtained, for example, from a
        Ping Identity Directory Server's encryption settings database), then
        the user will be interactively prompted for the passphrase.
    -i, --characterSet {charset}
        The character set/data encoding to use when reading data from files or
        standard input.  If this is not specified, the UTF-8 character set will
        be used by default.
    -R, --rejectFile {path}
        The path to a file that will be updated with the DNs of any entries
        that could not be deleted, along with information about the failed
        delete attempt.  If this is not provided, then failure information will
        only be written to standard error.
    -v, --verbose
        Generate verbose output.

  Delete Operation Arguments

    --neverRetry
        Indicates that the tool should not attempt to retry operations that
        fail in a way that the connection to the directory server may be
        invalid.  By default, it will automatically try to establish a new
        connection and retry the failed operation.
    -n, --dryRun
        Indicates that the tool should display what it would do, and may
        perform searches if appropriate, but will not actually attempt to
        delete any entries.  Note that if the server supports the no-operation
        request control, you may wish to use the --noOperation argument
        instead, which will actually send the delete requests with a control
        indicating that the server should perform as much validation of the
        request that it can, but should not actually delete the target entry.
    -c, --continueOnError
        Indicates that the tool should continue processing even after
        encountering an error.  This is only applicable if it is run with
        arguments that would cause it to attempt to delete multiple entries.
    --followReferrals
        Indicates that the tool should attempt to follow any referrals that it
        encounters.  By default, any referrals that are returned will be
        treated as failures.
    --useAdministrativeSession
        Indicates that the tool should attempt to use the Ping
        Identity-proprietary start administrative session extended operation to
        create an administrative session that will cause all requests to be
        processed in a dedicated pool of worker threads.  This may be useful
        when trying to diagnose or resolve an issue when all regular worker
        threads are busy processing other requests
    -r, --ratePerSecond {deletesPerSecond}
        The maximum number of delete operations that should be attempted per
        second.  If this is not provided, then no rate limit will be imposed on
        delete requests.

  Control Arguments

    --clientSideSubtreeDelete
        Indicates that all delete requests should be processed as client-side
        subtree deletes by searching for all entries below the target entry and
        then deleting them.
    -x, --serverSideSubtreeDelete
        Indicates that all delete requests should be processed as server-side
        subtree deletes by using the subtree delete request control.
    -s, --softDelete
        Indicates that delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary soft delete request control to indicate that the
        server should hide the entries rather than deleting them immediately.
        Soft-deleted may or may not be completely removed after a period of
        time, based on the server configuration.
    --hardDelete
        Indicates that delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary hard delete request control to indicate that the
        target entries should be completely removed, even if they would have
        otherwise been processed as soft deletes.
    -Y, --proxyAs {authzID}
        Indicates that search and delete requests should include the proxied
        authorization v2 request control, to request that they be processed
        under the authority of the specified user.
    --proxyV1As {dn}
        Indicates that search and delete requests should include the proxied
        authorization v1 request control, to request that they be processed
        under the authority of the specified user.
    --useManageDsaIT
        Indicates that search and delete requests should include the Manage DSA
        IT request control to indicate that the server should treat referral
        entries as regular entries.
    --assertionFilter {filter}
        Indicates that delete requests should include the assertion request
        control to indicate that the server should reject any attempt to delete
        an entry that does not match the provided filter.
    --preReadAttribute {attr}
        Indicates that delete requests should include the pre-read request
        control to indicate that delete responses should include a post-read
        response control with the values of the specified at the time the entry
        was deleted.  This may be provided multiple times to request multiple
        pre-read attributes.
    --noOperation
        Indicates that delete requests should include the no-operation request
        control to indicate that the server should perform as much processing
        as possible for the delete operation without actually removing the
        entry.
    --getBackendSetID
        Indicates that delete requests sent through a Directory Proxy Server
        should include the Ping Identity-proprietary get backend set ID request
        control to indicate that the response should include a control with the
        ID of the entry-balancing backend set in which the delete was
        processed.
    --routeToBackendSet {entry-balancing-processor-id:backend-set-id}
        Indicates that search and delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary route to backend set request control to indicate
        that the Directory Proxy Server should forward those requests to
        servers in the specified entry-balancing backend set.  This control may
        be provided multiple times to specify multiple backend sets for the
        same or different entry-balancing request processors.
    --getServerID
        Indicates that delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary get server ID request control to indicate that the
        response should include a control with the server ID of the Directory
        Server instance in which the delete was processed.
    --routeToServer {id}
        Indicates that search and delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary route to server request control to indicate that
        the Directory Proxy Server should forward those requests to the
        specified backend server.
    --useAssuredReplication
        Indicates that delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary assured replication request control to delay the
        response from the server until the change has been replicated to other
        servers.  The --assuredReplicationLocalLevel,
        --assuredReplicationRemoteLevel, and --assuredReplicationTimeout
        arguments may also be used to customize the content of the request
        control.
    --assuredReplicationLocalLevel
    {none|received-any-server|processed-all-servers}
        The replication assurance level that should be used for servers in the
        same location as the server that originally processed the change.  The
        value must be one of 'none', 'received-any-server', or
        'processed-all-servers'.  If this is not provided, the server will
        determine an appropriate local assurance level.
    --assuredReplicationRemoteLevel
    {none|received-any-remote-location|received-all-remote-locations|processed-
    all-remote-servers}
        The replication assurance level that should be used for servers in a
        different location from the server that originally processed the
        change.  The value must be one of 'none',
        'received-any-remote-location', 'received-all-remote-locations', or
        'processed-all-remote-servers'.  If this is not provided, the server
        will determine an appropriate remote assurance level.
    --assuredReplicationTimeout {duration}
        The maximum length of time that the server should delay the response to
        the delete operation while waiting for the desired replication
        assurance to be achieved.  If this is not provided, the server will
        determine an appropriate timeout to use.
    --replicationRepair
        Indicates that delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary replication repair request control to indicate
        that the delete operation should not be replicated.
    --suppressReferentialIntegrityUpdates
        Indicates that delete requests should include the Ping
        Identity-proprietary suppress referential integrity updates request
        control so that the server will not perform any referential integrity
        processing for the delete operation.
    --operationPurpose {value}
