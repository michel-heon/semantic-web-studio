    <h1>The parallel-update Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Use multiple concurrent threads to apply a set of add, delete, modify, and modify DN operations read from an LDIF file.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other tools like ldapmodify, changes in the LDIF file to be processed should be ordered such that if there are any dependencies between changes (for example, if one add change record creates a parent entry and another add change record creates a child of that parent), prerequisite changes come before the changes that depend on them.  When this tool is preparing to process a change, it will determine whether the new change depends on any other changes that are currently in progress, and if so, will delay processing that change until its dependencies have been satisfied.  If a change does not depend on any other changes that are currently being processed, then it can be processed in parallel with those changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool will keep track of any changes that fail in a way that indicates they succeed if re-tried later (for example, an attempt to add an entry that fails because its parent does not exist, but its parent may be created later in the set of LDIF changes), and can optionally re-try those changes after processing is complete.  Any changes that are not retried, as well as changes that still fail after the retry attempts, will be written to a rejects file with information about the reason for the failure so that an administrator can take any necessary further action upon them.

This control indicates that the server should not reject requests in which the client attempts to set values for attribute types declared with the NO-USER-MODIFICATION constraint in the schema.  This control primarily applies to add operations, but the server can be configured to allow it for a limited set of attributes in modify operation.

        A provided value must be able to be parsed as an LDAP distinguished name as described in RFC 4514.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--passwordUpdateBehavior <i>{name=value}</i></tt> &mdash; Include the proprietary password update behavior request control in all add and modify requests.

This control indicates that the server should treat referral entries as regular entries, and that the server should attempt to process that change directly against the referral entry rather generating a referral to indicate that the change should be sent to another server or to a different location in the same server.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--useHardDelete</tt> &mdash; Include the proprietary hard delete request control in all delete requests.  This control indicates that the server should completely remove the target entry, even if it would have otherwise automatically processed the operation as a soft delete.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

This control indicates that the server should un-delete the target soft-deleted entry rather than creating a new entry.  The server must be configured to allow soft delete operations, and the requester must hav ethe soft-delete-read privilege.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--useAssuredReplication</tt> &mdash; Include the UnboundID-proprietary assured replication request control to indicate that the update response should be delayed until the change has been sufficiently replicated to other servers.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--assuredReplicationLocalLevel <i>{none|received-any-server|processed-all-servers}</i></tt> &mdash; The replication assurance level that should be used for servers in the same location as the server that originally processed the change.
