    <h1>The identify-unique-attribute-conflicts Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      This tool may be used to identify unique attribute conflicts.  That is, it may identify values of one or more attributes which are supposed to exist only in a single entry but are found in multiple entries.
    </p>

        <br>
        A provided value should be one of the following:  'unique-within-each-attribute', 'unique-across-all-attributes-including-in-same-entry', 'unique-in-combination', 'unique-across-all-attributes-except-in-same-entry'.

This time limit is used to avoid sending expensive unindexed search requests that can consume significant server resources.  If any of these search operations fails in a way that indicates the requested time limit was exceeded, the tool will abort its processing.  A value of zero indicates that no time limit will be enforced.  If this argument is not provided, a default time limit of 10 will be used.
