    <h1>The split-ldif Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Splits a single LDIF file into multiple sets by separating entries below a specified base DN into different mutually-exclusive collections of entries.  A number of algorithms are available to determine how entries should be split, and entries outside the split base DN may be included in all sets or added to a dedicated LDIF file.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>split-ldif <i>{subCommand}</i> <i>{arguments}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      This tool uses subcommands to indicate which function you want to perform.

    <h3>Global Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>-l <i>{path}</i></tt> / <tt>--sourceLDIF <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to an LDIF file containing the data to be split into multiple sets.  This argument may be provided multiple times to specify multiple LDIF files, and the files will be processed in the order they were provided on the command line.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-C</tt> / <tt>--sourceCompressed</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the source LDIF files are gzip-compressed.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-o <i>{path}</i></tt> / <tt>--targetLDIFBasePath <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path and base name to use for the LDIF files containing the data that has been split.  The resulting LDIF files will use this path with different extensions ('.set1' for the first set, '.set2' for the second set, and so on, and '.outside-split-base-dn' if a file is to be created to hold entries that exist outside of the split base DN).  If this is not provided, then the source LDIF path will be used as the base name.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file which may or may not exist, but whose parent directory must exist.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>-c</tt> / <tt>--compressTarget</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the target LDIF files should be gzip-compressed.
        <br>

        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--encryptTarget</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the target LDIF files should be encrypted with a key generated from a provided passphrase.  If the --encryptionPassphraseFile argument is provided, then the passphrase will be read from the specified file.  Otherwise, it will be interactively requested from the user.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--encryptionPassphraseFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; The path to the file containing the passphrase to use to generate the encryption key.  This passphrase will be used to decrypt the input (if it is encrypted) and to encrypt the output (if it is to be encrypted).  If this is not provided and either the input or output is encrypted, then the passphrase will be interactively requested.  If it is provided, then the specified file must exist and must contain exactly one line that is comprised entirely of the encryption passphrase.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.

        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

      <li>Splits LDIF file 'whole.ldif' into four sets, with names starting with 'split.ldif', so that each entry immediately below 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' will be selected by matching that entry against a search filter.  Entries matching '(timeZone=Eastern)' will go into the first set, entries matching '(timeZone=Central)' into the second set, '(timeZone=Mountain)' into the third set, and '(timeZone=Pacific)' into the fourth.  Any entries not matching any of those filters will be placed by computing a hash on its RDN.</li>
