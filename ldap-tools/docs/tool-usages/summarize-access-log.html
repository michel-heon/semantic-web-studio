    <h1>The summarize-access-log Command-Line Tool</h1>

    <p>
      Examine one or more access log files from Ping Identity, UnboundID, or Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 server products to display a number of metrics about operations processed within the server.
    </p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>summarize-access-log <i>{arguments}</i> <i>{path}</i></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <tt>-c</tt> / <tt>--isCompressed</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the log file is compressed.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--encryptionPassphraseFile <i>{path}</i></tt> &mdash; Indicates that the log file is encrypted and that the encryption passphrase is contained in the specified file.  If the log data is encrypted and this argument is not provided, then the tool will interactively prompt for the encryption passphrase.
        <br>
        The specified path must refer to a file that exists.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--reportCount <i>{value}</i></tt> &mdash; The number of values to display for each item being summarized.  A value of zero indicates that all items should be displayed.  If this is not provided, a default value of 20 will be used.
        <br>
        The specified value must not be less than 0 or greater than 2 147 483 647.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--doNotAnonymize</tt> &mdash; Do not anonymize the output, but include actual attribute values in filters and DNs.  This will also have the effect of de-generifying those values, so output including the most common filters and DNs in some category will be specific instances of those filters and DNs instead of generic patterns.
        <br>
        This argument is not allowed to have a value.  If this argument is included in a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'true'.  If it is absent from a set of arguments, then it will be assumed to have a value of 'false'.

        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <tt>--appendToOutputFile</tt> &mdash; Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
        <br>

      </li>
      <li>
