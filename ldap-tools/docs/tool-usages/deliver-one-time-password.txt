Usage for deliver-one-time-password:

Generate and deliver a one-time password to a user through some out-of-band

UNBOUNDID-DELIVERED-OTP SASL mechanism.

Usage:  deliver-one-time-password {options}

Available options include:

  LDAP Connection Arguments

    -h, --hostname {host}
        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -Z, --useSSL
        Use SSL when communicating with the directory server.
    -q, --useStartTLS
        Use StartTLS when communicating with the directory server.
    --defaultTrust
        Use the JVM's default trust store, and optionally an additional trust
        store specified using the --trustStorePath argument, to
        non-interactively determine whether to trust any certificate chain
        presented during TLS negotiation.  If the chain cannot be trusted based
        on any of those sources, then negotiation will fail without prompting
        about whether to trust it.
    -X, --trustAll
        Trust any certificate presented by the directory server.
    -K, --keyStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as the key store for obtaining client
        certificates when communicating securely with the directory server.
    -W, --keyStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the key store contents.
    -u, --keyStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the key
        store contents.
    --promptForKeyStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the key store contents.
    --keyStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the key store
        file.
    -P, --trustStorePath {path}
        The path to the file to use as trust store when determining whether to
        trust a certificate presented by the directory server.
    -T, --trustStorePassword {password}
        The password to use to access the trust store contents.
    -U, --trustStorePasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to access the trust
        store contents.
    --promptForTrustStorePassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        password to use to access the trust store contents.
    --trustStoreFormat {format}
        The format (e.g., JKS, PKCS12, PKCS11, BCFKS, etc.) for the trust store
        file.
    -N, --certNickname {nickname}
        The nickname (alias) of the client certificate in the key store to
        present to the directory server for SSL client authentication.
    --enableSSLDebugging
        Enable Java's low-level support for debugging SSL/TLS communication.
        This is equivalent to setting the 'javax.net.debug' property to 'all'.

  Identification and Authentication Arguments

    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN for the user to whom the one-time password should be delivered.
        Either the bind DN or username must be provided.
    -n, --userName {username}
        The username for the user to whom the one-time password should be
        delivered.  Either the bind DN or username must be provided.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The static password for the user to whom the one-time password should
        be delivered.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to a file containing the static password for the user to whom
        the one-time password should be delivered.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the
        bind password.

  Delivery Mechanism Arguments

    -m, --deliveryMechanism {name}
        The name of the mechanism that should be used to deliver the one-time
        password to the user.  If multiple values are specified (using multiple
        instances of this argument) then they will be tried in the order in
        which they are given until one of them is able to deliver the one-time
        password.  If this is not specified, then the server configuration will
        dictate which delivery mechanisms should be attempted.
    -s, --messageSubject {subject}
        The subject to use for the message containing the one-time password.
        This will be ignored for delivery mechanisms that do not require a
        subject.
    -f, --fullTextBeforeOTP {text}
        The text to include immediately before the one-time password in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that does not impose
        a significant constraint on message size.
    -F, --fullTextAfterOTP {text}
        The text to include immediately after the one-time password in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that does not impose
        a significant constraint on message size.
    -c, --compactTextBeforeOTP {text}
        The text to include immediately before the one-time password in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that imposes a
        significant constraint on message size.
    -C, --compactTextAfterOTP {text}
        The text to include immediately after the one-time password in the
        message delivered to the end user via a mechanism that imposes a
        significant constraint on message size.

  Usage Arguments

    --interactive

    --outputFile {path}
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the specified
        file instead of to the console.
    --appendToOutputFile
        Indicates that the tool should append to the file specified by the
        --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
        provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
    --teeOutput
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as
        well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must
        also be provided.
    -H, --help
        Display usage information for this program.
    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.
    --propertiesFilePath {path}
        The path to a properties file used to specify default values for
        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

Examples

  Generate and deliver a one-time password to the user with DN
  'uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' via the default mechanisms
  configured in the server.

    deliver-one-time-password --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com \
         --bindPassword password --messageSubject "Your one-time password" \
         --fullTextBeforeOTP "Your one-time password is '" \
         --fullTextAfterOTP "'." --compactTextBeforeOTP "Your OTP is '" \
         --compactTextAfterOTP "'."

  Generate and deliver a one-time password to the user with username
  'test.user' via SMS if possible, or e-mail as a second choice.

    deliver-one-time-password --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --userName test.user --bindPassword password \
         --deliveryMechanism SMS --deliveryMechanism E-Mail \
         --messageSubject "Your one-time password" \
         --fullTextBeforeOTP "Your one-time password is '" \
         --fullTextAfterOTP "'." --compactTextBeforeOTP "Your OTP is '" \
         --compactTextAfterOTP "'."
