Available options include:

  LDAP Connection and Authentication Arguments

        The IP address or resolvable name to use to connect to the directory
        server.  If this is not provided, then a default value of 'localhost'
        will be used.
    -p, --port {port}
        The port to use to connect to the directory server.  If this is not
        provided, then a default value of 389 will be used.
    -D, --bindDN {dn}
        The DN to use to bind to the directory server when performing simple
        authentication.
    -w, --bindPassword {password}
        The password to use to bind to the directory server when performing
        simple authentication or a password-based SASL mechanism.
    -j, --bindPasswordFile {path}
        The path to the file containing the password to use to bind to the
        directory server when performing simple authentication or a
        password-based SASL mechanism.
    --promptForBindPassword
        Indicates that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the

        file.

  Rate Management Arguments

    -t, --numThreads {num}
        The number of threads to use to perform the searches.  If this is not
        provided, then a default of one thread will be used.
    -i, --intervalDuration {num}
        The length of time in seconds between output lines.  If this is not
        provided, then a default interval of five seconds will be used.
    -I, --numIntervals {num}
        The maximum number of intervals for which to run.  If this is not
        provided, then the tool will run until it is interrupted.
    --iterationsBeforeReconnect {num}
        The number of search and modify iterations that should be processed on
        a connection before that connection is closed and replaced with a
        newly-established (and authenticated, if appropriate) connection.  If
        this is not provided, then connections will not be periodically closed
        and re-established.
    -r, --ratePerSecond {searches-per-second}
        The target number of searches to perform per second.  It is still
        necessary to specify a sufficient number of threads for achieving this
        rate.  If neither this option nor --variableRateData is provided, then
        the tool will run at the maximum rate for the specified number of
        threads.
    --variableRateData {path}
        The path to a file containing information that can be used to cause the
        tool to vary the target rate over time.  Use the generateSampleRateFile
        argument to generate a sample rate definition file with comments that
        describe the required format for this file.
    --generateSampleRateFile {path}
        The path to a sample variable data rate file that should be generated.
        This file will contain comments that describe the expected format for
        the file to use with the variableRateData argument.
    --warmUpIntervals {num}
        The number of intervals to complete before beginning overall statistics
        collection.  Specifying a nonzero number of warm-up intervals gives the
        client and server a chance to warm up without skewing performance
        results.

  Other Arguments

    --timestampFormat {format}
        Indicates the format to use for timestamps included in the output.  A
        value of 'none' indicates that no timestamps should be included.  A
        value of 'with-date' indicates that both the date and the time should
        be included.  A value of 'without-date' indicates that only the time
        should be included.
    --suppressErrorResultCodes
        Indicates that information about the result codes for failed operations
        should not be displayed.
    -c, --csv
        Generate output in CSV format rather than a display-friendly format
    -R, --randomSeed {value}
        Specifies the seed to use for the random number generator.

        --outputFile argument if it already exists.  If this argument is not
        provided and the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.
    --teeOutput
        Write all standard output and standard error messages to the console as
        well as to the specified output file.  The --outputFile argument must
        also be provided.
    -H, --help
        Display usage information for this program.
    -V, --version
        Display version information for this program.
    --propertiesFilePath {path}
        The path to a properties file used to specify default values for
        arguments not supplied on the command line.
    --generatePropertiesFile {path}
        Write an empty properties file that may be used to specify default
        values for arguments.
    --noPropertiesFile
        Do not obtain any argument values from a properties file.
    --suppressPropertiesFileComment
        Suppress output listing the arguments obtained from a properties file.

  * Indicates the argument is required

Examples

  Test search and modify performance by searching randomly across a set of one
  million users located below 'dc=example,dc=com' with ten concurrent threads.
  The entries returned to the client will include the givenName, sn, and mail
  attributes, and the description attribute of each entry returned will be
  replaced with a string of ten randomly-selected alphanumeric characters.

    search-and-mod-rate --hostname server.example.com --port 389 \
         --bindDN uid=admin,dc=example,dc=com --bindPassword password \
         --baseDN dc=example,dc=com --scope sub \
         --filter "(uid=user.[1-1000000])" --attribute givenName \
         --attribute sn --attribute mail --modifyAttribute description \
         --valueLength 10 \
         --characterSet abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 --numThreads 10

  Generate a sample variable rate definition file that may be used in
  conjunction with the --variableRateData argument.  The sample file will
  include comments that describe the format for data to be included in this
  file.
