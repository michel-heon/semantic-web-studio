cap_map_text1=Enter a research area into the search field above and press 'Search'. The resulting diagram displays the search term, rendered in orange, connected to the blue group of researchers that are active in that area. Enter another search term to see how researchers from both searches relate. Keep adding search terms to build a capability map.
selected_document=Selected Document
cap_map_text2=Tip: you can expand a broad search term into smaller concepts by clicking &lsquo;search and expand&rsquo;.
cap_map_text3=By clicking on any node in the visualisation, additional information can be viewed in the 'Info' tab on the right-hand side. For groups of people, the participants in the group and their information can be viewed, and individual researchers can be removed from the graph. Selecting a search term will display all attached groups. Under each group full information for each person is retrieved, and the number of matching grants and publications for each researcher within the mapped capabilities is shown. Clicking on a researcher's name will lead to the original search results.
cap_map_text4=To make the visualisation easier to read, search terms and groups are scaled according to the number of results returned. Groups are also given different shades according to the number of connected search terms. The darker the shade, the more search terms a group is connected to.
